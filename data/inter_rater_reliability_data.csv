I don't expect to drastically change the code base of a legacy system for any of the above reasons. However, the current system has major issues: poor performance and substantial logic errors. But this alone does not merit a conversion, does it? It should also be noted that the developers are equally strong in each language so that doesn't have a bearing on the question. strongAre there any substantial benefits, such as performance gains, that would be achieved by converting 65K lines of code from VB to C?/strong  After my research, I'm not convinced that a conversion would be beneficial.",1,requirements,2,1,requirements,2

631900,"Branching hell, where is the risk vs productivity tipping point?","My company is floating the idea of extending our version numbers another notch (e.g. from major.minor.servicepack to major.minor.servicepack.customerfix) to allow for customer specific fixes. This strikes me as a bad idea on the surface as my experience is the more branching a product does (and I believe the customer fixes are branches of the code base) the more overhead, the more dilution of effort and ultimately the less productive the development group becomes. I've seen a lot of risk vs productivity discussions but just saying I think this is a bad idea isn't quite sufficient. What literature is there about the real costs of becoming too risk averse and adopting a heavy, customer specific, source code branching, development model? A little clarification. I expect this model would mean the customer has control over what bug fixes go into their own private branch. I think they would rarely upgrade to the general trunk (it may not even exist in this model). I mean why would you if you could control your own private reality bubble?",1,versioning,2,1,versioning,3
58741360,Refactor/Restructure Code Before Swapping Out UI Framework?,"The team I belong to at work is planning to swap out the UI framework we currently use, Om, with another one, re-frame. The main reason for the swap is that Om is no longer supported and we've built a simple proof-of-concept in re-frame that seems promising. In addition to the unsupported framework we currently use, our code is also in need of a refactor. Much of the UI code is in one large file (~3k lines). My preferred approach would be to first complete the refactoring on the existing Om code and split up the large file into many small files to make things more manageable and also restructure the files into a more intuitive file structure. After that, we would re-write the UI code using re-frame. My coworker would prefer to skip the refactor/restructure and write the UI code in re-frame. My thought process behind wanting to refactor first is that we would: ul liBe able to identify dead code and remove it/li liHave smaller, more organized files that would be easier to convert over to use the new framework/li liExtract common code that will be reused in the re-frame code so we have one copy of that common code that would be simultaneously used in Production by the Om code and by the re-frame code as it's being developed/li liDecrease the risk of project failure by doing one thing at a time (first the refactor and then UI framework swap)/li /ul  My coworker's thought process behind wanting to skip the refactor is that we would: ul liSave time and effort by not refactoring code that will be thrown out/li liTake advantage of the fact that we are in a lull period in between large projects to complete the UI framework swap, before we eventually get busy again and won't have time to address large technical debt/li /ul  I feel like my preferred approach is possibly slower but less risky. While my coworker's approach may be faster as long as things go smoothly, it seems riskier and would be more difficult to validate that we've fully reproduced the legacy functionality in the new code.

607683,n-Tier Architecture Feedback Needed,"I started my website, like stackoverflow, with a little technical debt that I'm trying to pay off. Being a contract developer, I've been in many places and see many different methods of achieving this result, but the way I'm going is.. Presentation (web) Business Layer (old fashioned entity classes and BL layer) Data Layer (DA classes to SQL Server via Stored Proc) My question primarily concerns the Business Layer. Right now I have an Entity namespace and a BusinessLogic namespace.  The BL has a reference to the DA and the Entity. The Entity has a reference to the DA (The DA is unaware of the BL or Entity) I really want all my churning of turning Data into Entities to occur within the BL -- thus the Business Logic. However, I want the Entity to be able to access the BL if need be -- and thus remove the Entity's reference to the DL. So... Is is wrong to have the BL and Entity objects within the same namespace so they can work together? Essentially, I'm trying have an entity object like Employee (classic emple, eh?) and have the Employee have a precodepublic Hashtable[] SubordinateEmployees /code/pre  property that returns a Hashtable of other Employee objects that report to this employee. But I don't want to load it until it's needed. So for most employees the property would never get accessed, but when it does, it self-loads with a call to the BL, which calls the DA. Does the question make sense? If so, does my solution?  Thanks so much in advance!",1,architecture,3,1,architecture,3

However the number of developers per app/team does not scale well. Parallel development of multiple independent apps by independent teams however can be scaled arbitrarily With this in mind it is imperative that teams can choose their own toolstack and especially perform independent version-upgrades of third party-libraries (like angular, react, jquery). If this was not the case a framework-update would need to be compatible with every single component before you could deploy it to production. h1Does this work with Angular?/h1  While independent version-upgrades are necessary, it would be reasonable to restrict the teams to a few supported frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, Polymer...) and for now I try to build a demo purely consisting of Angular-Apps. However even though Angular 5 is supposedly a platform-framework which supports huge multi-module apps, it seems to be almost impossible to have several independent angular-apps running in the same browser window. I managed to bootstrap several Angular-Apps (different versions, each hosted on its own server) on a single webapp by utilizing HTML-Imports.

2640386,"Reuse, Rewrite, or Refactor?","At work I inherited development of a PHP-based Web site after the consultant who originally produced it bailed out and left without a trace. Literally half of the code is ripped from online tutorials, and there are thousands of lines of cruft that, being incomplete, do precious little. Hardly any of it actually works. I've been trying to pull out the usable components, such as the layout (cleverly intermixed with code), session management (delicately seasoned with unescaped, unvalidated SQL queries), and a few other things, but it's very difficult to force all of this junk into place. Further, I don't speak idiomatic PHP, being more of a Perl user, and I'm supposed to be on this project principally for maintenance, so rewriting everything seems like it would take just as long as wrestling the existing monster back into place.

2685483,Whats so bad about binding your View to Property of a Model and NOT ViewModel?,I often hear a Model must be wrapped by a ViewModel that the View is not coupled to the Model/not aware of it. With MVC it is common to bind the View to the Model... nobody complains so what ? I am frightened of creating all that wrappers and doing nearly only duplicating property stuff.,1,design,5,1,architecture,5
52523547,Modify a TypeScript type alias from @types type,"Using Typescript 3, I'm using a definition from DefinitelyTyped but I need to edit a type alias. I am using @types/json-schema for the TS definitions which is easy to use. But since I want to add a custom schema type, when I have a type that isn't one of the defined types it will obviously complain. For emple, I have this schema: precode{  properties: {  foo: { type: 'myCustomFormat' }  },  required: [  'foo'  ],  type: 'object' } /code/pre  And of course codemyCustomFormat/code is not a valid json schema type. @types/json-schema defines these types via: precodeexport type JSONSchema4TypeName = 'string' | 'number' | 'integer' | 'boolean' | 'object' | 'array' | 'null' | 'any' /code/pre  Is there a way to modify that type alias in my own type definition and have all uses of codeJSONSchema4TypeName/code updated since @types/json-schema obviously uses codeJSONSchema4TypeName/code further in it's definition? So like I'd like to do: precodeimport { JSONSchema4TypeName } from 'json-schema';  export type JSONSchema4TypeName = JSONSchema4TypeName | 'myCustomFormat'; /code/pre  The closest I'm able to do is this: precodeimport { JSONSchema4, JSONSchema4TypeName } from 'json-schema';  export type JSONSchema4TypeName = JSONSchema4TypeName | 'uuid';  export interface JSONSchema4 {  type?: JSONSchema4TypeName | JSONSchema4TypeName[]; } /code/pre  and I import that codeJSONSchema4/code from my definition instead of json-schema and that feels like it creates technical debt so wondering if there was a better way.",1,design,4,1,design,4
5895805,Properly calling the database from Model in an MVC application?,"I'm building a tiny MVC framework for learning/experimenting and small project purposes. I needed to find out the basics of the internals of the Model since a full MVC framework and ORM is overkill for just a few database calls. precodeClass Model { } /code/pre  Using an empty class where would I have to call a codenew PDO/code object for database calls? What would calling a query look like inside the Model? Additionally, where can I find a beginner's web/book resource to MVC (with lots of emple code)? I've heard a lot of terms such as business logic and database logic. I remember reading somewhere that you should separate business logic and database logic. I can understand the concept somewhat, I just wonder what it looks like or what they mean in code itself. I'm confused how business logic and database logic should be separated but still be inside the Model. I'm mostly looking for code/logic emples as answers, except maybe the latter paragraph.",0,,,0,,

But I have recently discovered EZ Publish is now running on the Symfony2 stack with version 5.
My question is, what does EZ bring to the table? Will it save me time and money in realising the end product? Or will it ultimately prove to be a hindrance if it is designed to be 'easy' rather than flexible?
Thoughts and suggestions are welcome :) Thanks for your time",0,,,0,,
23056418,Preferable way of making code testable: Dependency injection vs encapsulation,"I often find myself wondering what is the best practice for these problems. An example: I have a java program which should get the air temperature from a weather web service. I encapsulate this in a class which creates a HttpClient and does a Get REST request to the weather service. Writing a unit test for the class requires to stub the HttpClient so that dummy data can be received in stead. There are som options how to implement this: strongDependency Injection in constructor./strong This breaks encapsulation. If we switch to a SOAP web service in stead, then a SoapConnection has to be injected instead of HttpClient. strongCreating a setter only for the purpose of testing./strong The normal HttpClient is constructed by default, but it is also possible to change the HttpClient by using the setter. strongReflection./strong Having the HttpClient as a private field set by the constructor (but not taking it by parameter), and then let the test use reflection to change it into a stubbed one. strongPackage private./strong Lower the field restriction to make it accessible in test. When trying to read about best practices on the subject it seems to me that the general consensus is that dependency injection is the preferred way, but I think the downside of breaking encapsulation is not given enough thought. strongWhat to you think is the preferred way to make a class testable?/strong",1,testing,1,0,,

They deal with floating point by using codeNSNumberFormatter/code, as I can see it's not a big problem (yet?). Those currency is stored to coredata.

30624089,Import Jasmine test results into SonarQube,"I've encountered a couple issues when trying to display the passing and failing Jasmine specs in my SonarQube instance for a Javascript project. I use Maven to manage running the tests, via the very nice maven-jasmine-plugin, which provides a very simple setup for integrating with RequireJS and spitting out a JUnit-style XML report in my code/target/code directory. I'd like to use that report in Sonar. The first issue is that, if the tests are asynchronous, Jasmine reports a time of undefined for that test, which the Sonar Runner cannot parse, dying with an error: blockquote  Fail to parse the Surefire report:   Caused by: java.text.ParseException: Unparseable number: undefined  Caused by: Unparseable number: undefined/blockquote  If I manually edit the TEST-jasmine.xml report to simply change undefined to 0, the report can be parsed, but then I get the following warning: blockquote  WARN - Test result will not be saved for test class jasmine, because SonarQube associated resource has not been found using file name: jasmine.js/blockquote  This is on SonarQube 5.1 with the 2.5 version of the JavaScript plugin.

52690013,Where to put my standard library headers when creating classes in C++?,"Correct me if I am wrong, the ifndef stuff in the beginning of C++ headers specifically help avoid code from being repeated? So (according to best practice) where do I put basic library headers like &amp;lt; iostream or &amp;lt; string ? Let me clarify the question with an emple Lets say I have a program that creates Employee classes and stores info about them..like their names or something ol liI have an int main() that uses std::cout ALOT to display info to console. It may even use hard coded string variables to store info into one of the classes (i know hard coding is bad just bear with me it will help clarify things for me)/p/li liI have a header called Employee.h with all my private variables..in this case the name of the employee.. and it also had the function declarations. Lets pretend it uses a string data type in one of the constructors./p/li lian Employee.cpp that does setting and getting...cool Lets also pretend it has some weird function that manipulates the Employee name (which is a string) and add like yolo in front of it..cool. So this file will also require acsess to the &amp;lt; string library/p/li /ol  strongSo far: all three of my files want to use the &amp;lt; string header and only the main.cpp wants to use the &amp;lt; iostream header./strong My question(s): Seems like the &amp;lt; string header can be placed in the Eployee header and not the main.cpp and the program will compile and run just fine...but if i put it in the main and not the Employee header the compiler goes wild. So should I include it in both main and header or just the header? Does this best practice change if I make a second class called Companies that also uses the string library?  P.S. can somone please explain how common preprocessors link stuff..like why does the computer throw erros when &amp;lt; string is only included in main but not the header...I thought this stuff was all linked together...Im dumb pls explain (I think i understand all the mumbo jumbo about obj files but then how doe preprocessors and compilers know that the header code isnt being repeated in both the class .cpp and the main .cpp?

I am trying to decide how best to architect it so that I can keep upgrading spree without fear of it breaking my modifications.

This works fine however there are two issues.1.) It can be harder to reason about the program when classes are opened up and extended via decorators. Its much easier if you can open up the file eg Spree::Product and look at the code and then work your way up the ancestors rather than knowing that in various parts in your system the class is being opened up and modified.2.) It can be hard to upgrade Spree if you go down this route. If you have overridden a view and it changes in the next version of spree you have no way of knowing. All you can do is upgrade and hope that one of your tests or manual testing picks it up if it breaks.The benefit of the above however is of course that its a very easy way to get started with modifications and if you are making few and small modifications then its probably fine.However are there better alternatives? One approach that I have been considering is simply forking Spree and making the changes directly in the forked spree codebase. I could then simply pull any new changes from spree into my forked repo when I want to upgrade. The advantage of this approach is that git will notify me whenever there is a change in a view that I have overridden. I can then merge this manually and either ignore it or take action. Has anyone in here done this in practice? Are there any drawbacks that I am overlooking?",1,architecture,3,1,architecture,3

28772939,TFS 2013 Real world work item usage and workflow,"The team I manage has been using TFS for years, but we've used a 3rd party system for tracking bugs and features. I'm looking to upgrade our team into TFS 2013 and I've done tons of reading and research into how TFS manages work items, backlogs, iterations, tasks etc. And although I understand the principles of what 'can' be done, I'm having a hard time visualizing 'how' our team would work with these work items as tasks.  If anyone knows of any best practice guides for actual sample based usage, or can answer any of these questions that'd be great 1) Product backlog - Under the 'configure schedule and iterations' what is the concept for setting the current 'backlog iteration'? Our team uses short 2 week iterations with a build number, but setting the build iteration as the current backlog makes all new PBI's scoped to only that iteration. Any items not complete in that iteration would disappear once I set the current build to the next iteration number. On the other hand, if I set it to the parent root node, I could see the PBI list getting rather large over time. What is the best method for managing PBI's that are unassigned and working in a simple Parent-build1/build2 etc structure? 2) Features - So I create a feature, perhaps it spans many work items and several tasks. They get completed over time, but I've noticed there's no 'auto' complete or status updates on parent items. So who/when is a Feature item supposed to get marked complete? If the product owner is supposed to use the features list to get an overview of work, they have no idea if all the dependent items have been complete and when to mark the feature Done. 3) Work Items - Managing these, and in particular their 'state' or status seems like a royal pain. On the task board you can't change their state, only their tasks with drag-drop, which is nice. But you complete all the tasks, and the parent work item stays in status 'New'. Do you really have to micro-manage every work item, open it up, and set the state to Done? 4) QA/testing - For every work item, each team member is responsible for testing each item, so every item is tested by multiple people, and logging any issues found. What's the best way to use work items or tasks for this?  5) Build Complete - Once every work item in the iteration is marked Done then I assume they are removed from the product backlog correct? The exception to this seems to be the features they were tied to, the feature item itself remains open. How do stakeholders view a list of features that were completed in the current build?",0,,,0,,
3505601,agile friendly way to integrate two separate applications/teams,"We have two distinct agile teams, each working on separate, but related, applications.br Each team has, until now, been able to work in an independent fashion (distinct code bases, persistence stores, sprints, backlogs etc). Recently, product management decided that these applications will become even more closely integrated. On a side note, the size of each team (comprised of QAs, Devs, BAs) will be increasing over the next 6-12 months. Management has decided to keep the agile process largely intact, since it has worked well (two teams working independently as much as possible) but have floated the idea of a contract-based service layer as means of integrating the applications.  In each sprint, any story that requires integration with the other application will be identified. At that point, an additional integration story will be added to the other teams backlog. That team will then be tasked with fulfilling the contract. In the meantime, the other team can continue their original story work, substituting a mock/fake service until the other team produces a working service. Since Agile preaches a KISS philosphy, several people on the teams have taken issue with the complexity of this approach. They are advocating continued used of stored procedure sharing as a leaner/simpler integration methodology that has worked well in the past.  I prefer contract based programming for all sorts of reasons, but the main reason is it's ability to provide compile time visibility into the behavior your application is expected to provide. You also get clear boundaries around who owns what code, and whose code you are likely to break if you break your contract. Stored procedures do none of that.  Since we have already reaped many benefits from agile, I'd like to think that there is already an agile-friendly way to deal with this kind of app integration/synchronization. Does creating a contract based SOA layer meet the agile smell test? Is there a third option I haven't considered?",0,,,0,,
7761027,Using NoSQL database for relational purpose,"Non-relational databases are attracting more attention day by day. The main limitation is that today's complicated data are indeed connected. Isn't it convenient to connect databases as we connect tables in RDBMS? Of course, I just mean simple cases. Imagine three tables of Articles, Tags, Relationships. In a RDBMS like Mysql, we can run three queries to 1. Find ID of a given tag 2. Find Articles connected with the captured Tag ID 3. Fetch the contents of Articles tagged with the term Instead of three queries, we perform a single query by JOIN. I think three queries in a key/value database like BerkeleyDB is faster than a JOIN query in Mysql. Is this idea practical? Or other issues are involved to ignore this approach?",0,,,0,,

But for the past six months, most feature implementation fell under category 2). The system is mature, forcing me to refactor and test everytime I want to add new modules. Additionally, I find myself breaking things that use to work, and fixing it (I don't get paid for this).The client is starting to express frustration at the time and cost for me to implement new features. To them, many of the feature requests are of the same scale as the features they requested six months ago. For emple, a client would ask, &quot;If it took you 1 week to build a ticketing system last year, why does it take you 1 month to build an event registration system today? An event registration system is much simpler than a ticketing system. It should only take you 1 week!&quot; Because of this scenario, I fear feature requests will soon land in category 3).

I need this to be retrofittable to a legacy application as part of major refactoring (technical debt), so simplicity is essential of the used libraries. I do not mind having to do a bit of coding in our application, but it must be very visible what is going on. AOP has a tendency for moving stuff out of the way, and that may make the application harder to maintain.Edit: We have now reached the point where we actually need to make a decision. The application will probably live for decades so we need to make a reversible decision with a framework that will be maintained for hopefully as long. I really like the static type check available with Guice, but not that the annotations bind explicitly to Guice instead of being external like in Spring. I also like that code appears to be more concise when using Guice as opposed to Spring. We need something that is robust and helpful. We do not need more than just DI at the moment.

316285,Shared Purpose tables in database design ( how would *you* implement a question/answer facility ),"I have long considered the design of a database that involves shared table purposes to be somewhat a trait of smelly code, and progressively increasing proliferation of smelly-code related problems. By this I mean, people over-normalizing, using 1 table where 2 tables could be more logical, people who've just discovered what normalizing is and overuse it to the point where they virtually layer a database on a database, or trying to use hierarchical data naively to solve all their problems.  The question is, when you have 2 sets of data, which appear to be the same, but they have a different purpose, do you use the same table to represent it? When do you know when it is a good idea and a bad idea to use this?  I've always been of the mind that needless self-referencing tables or structures that involved any table being used twice in the same query was a very dangerous predicament, both in design, and in long term performance and ease of future improvement. That was of course, until I saw a thing or two in the RSS feeds for SO here. Now I'm not going onto a meta discussion about how SO works, but there appears to be an implicit design consideration here that challenged my thinking and want to glean a more cohesive answer on that style of logic.  You'll notice the generic question has the format:  precode /question/1234/stuff-here-that-s-safe-to-leave-out /code/pre  And I generally assumed that this implied that questions were numerically ordered somewhere.  But here is what stumped me: I'll take for emple a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/316210question 316210/a. If you look at the a href=https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/question/316210rss feed/a for this question, you will note there is a entry for the question, and a series of answer entries, which are functionally identical for the question entry except for a few minor differences. Now note in the answer entries also have link references, ... to questions, not the same question however, but to different questions, such as a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/316218/question 316218/a, which , when visited, redirects you back to the original question.  Now I'm not interested in emhow/em they implement that in the code, the problem is that you have here, questions and answers appear to be sharing the same table ( hence the sequential question ID's ) , and when users refer to an answer ID, you have to first query the database, and then go hey!, oops!, that's not a question! and then proceed to do a emsecond/em query to find out the parent of that question ( in the same table ) and then redirect you to the actual question page, not to mention all the hullabaloo required with self joining queries ( which I've always considered filthy ) and conditionals all over the place to tune behavior.  h3Less Digressing, the real problem/h3  The problem is, here you have 2 sets of data sharing the same table, and sure, this data is superficially similar, for now at least, but there looks like there is just so much strongtechnical debt/strong involved.  The long term considerations involved with implementing new features that can apply to questions and not answers and vice versa, not to mention avoiding one being interpreted as another in some obscure corner. You can't add a new column for use in one application set without having to consider the resulting effects in another.  Sure, there is a minor benefit from using the singular table and that's when you emare/em making a feature that is shared between facets you only have to code it once, but this could be just as easily represented by using an ancestor class of common methods, and child classes that bind to the specific tables for the difference cases. So at least that way, adding a new feature has no follow-on implications for the other scenario.  Now I've encountered this sort of problem in many places before, sure, but SO is the most easy emple to point out.

Thank you for bearing with me so far.As I got more knowledgeable with Fragments, especially with lifecyle (livedata) and navigation, I came to release that my fragments instance are saved (a behavior I was indeed looking for).So, instead of constantly re-creating my views, I kept a reference of them in order to re-display them in any subsequent call to my nested fragment codeonCreateView method.It worked quite well for a time until I had to implement an external library that exposes a fragment with it's own custom nested navigation (emyes, it gets that complicated/em - two-levels of nested navigation !).Hence the reason I decided to rewrite my codeBottomNavigationView's navigation.And there is my problem: upon re-attaching a previously detached Fragment, the content is blank. And, after working with background colors, I came to understand that using codeattach and codedetach do work as expected and does hide / display my codeNestedNavigationFragments, but their content is nowhere to be seen.Using the debugger, I came to realize that while my codeNestedNavigationFragments codeonCreateView methods are indeed called, the same cannot be said for the previously displayed nested (child) fragment!The solution I found so far (as stated in the intro), is to not re-use the same view of my codeNestedNavigationFragments. I have to re-create the view each time.Doing so caused the nested fragments codeonCreateView to be finally called and allowed them to use cache views ! Hourah !Hourah ... ? Really ? Well I suppose not, if, in turn a nested fragment starts using a nested navigation graph. That's what I happen with that aforementionned external library ! Thankfully enough, I am work on this library so I can fix this. And that's why I came here, to see if my logic is faulted.Conclusion/That's why, upon discovering this, I came to ask your opinion about re-using cached views of fragments.It does not seem to cause any issue with fragments that are not nested, but as soon you get nested fragments, all hell breaks loose.Is that normal behavior ? Did I do something wrong ? Is there a better way to that ? Some Fragment's view are heavy, and re-creating them would be too costly...Thank you for reading and looking forward to your thoughts and answer !",1,design,5,1,design,5
394223,How do you decide when to upgrade a library in your project?,"I work on a project that uses multiple open source Java libraries. When upgrades to those libraries come out, we tend to follow a conservative strategy:  ol liif it ain't broke, don't fix it  liif it doesn't have new features we want, ignore it  /ol  We follow this strategy because we usually don't have time to put in the new library and thoroughly test the overall application. (Like many software development teams we're always behind schedule on features we promised months ago.) But, I sometimes wonder if this strategy is wise given that some performance improvements and a large number of bug fixes usually come with library upgrades. (i.e. Who knows, maybe things will work better in a way we don't foresee...)  What criteria do you use when you make these types of decisions in your project? ",1,infrastructure,2,1,architecture,2
1891466,So.. I need to train the team on Unit Testing - could use C C on lesson plan,"So - management is looking to do a push to move towards doing unit-testing in all the applications moving forward - and eventually get into full TDD/Continuous Integration/Automated build mode (I hope). At this point however we are just concerned about getting everyone developing apps moving forward using unit-testing. I'd like to just start with the basics. I won't lie - I'm by far no expert by any means in unit-testing, but I do have a good enough understanding to start the initiative with the basics, and allow us to grow togeather as a team. I'd really love to get some comments  amp; critisism from all you experts on my plan of attack on this thing. It's a team of about 10 developers in a small shop, which makes for a great opportunity to move forward with agile development methodologies and best practices. First off - the team consists of mainly mid level developers with a couple of junior devs and one senior, all with minimal to no exposure to unit testing. The training will be a semi-monthly meeting for about 30-60 minutes each time (probably wind up running an hour long i'd guess, and maybe have them more often). We will continue these meetings until it makes sense to stop them to allow others to catch up with their own 'homework' and experience - but the push will always be on. Anyway - here is my lesson plan I have come up with. Well, the first two at least. Any advice from your experts out there on the actual content or structure of the lessons, etc, would be great. Comments  amp; Critisism greatly appreciated. Thanks very much. I apologize if this is 'too much' to post in here or read through. I think this would be a great thread for SO users looking to get into unit testing in the first place as well. Perhaps you could just skip to the 'lesson plans' section - thanks again everyone. strongemCLIFF NOTES/em/strong - I realize this post is incredibly long and ugly, so here is the cliff notes - Lesson 1 will be 'hello world unit tests' - Lesson 2 will be opening the solution to my most recent application, and showing how to apply each 'hello world' emple in real life... Thanks so much everyone for the feedback you've given me so far.. just wantd to highlight the fact that lesson 2 emis/em going to have real life production unit tests in it, since many suggested I do that when it was my plan from the begining =) strongemUnit Testing Lesson Plan/em/strong strongOverview/strong Why unit test? Seems like a bunch of extra work - so why do it? • Become the master of your own destiny. Most of our users do not do true UATs, and unfortunately tend to do their testing once in production. With unit-tests, we greatly decrease risk associated with this, especially when we create enough test data and take into account as many top level inputs as we possibly can. While not being a ‘silver bullet’ that prevents all bugs – it is your first line of defense – a huge front line, comparable to that of the SB championship Giants. • Unit-Testing enforces good design and architecture practices. It is ‘the violent psychopath who maintains your code and knows where you live’ so to say. You simply can’t write poor quality code that is well unit-tested • How many times have you not refactored smelly code because you were too scared of breaking something? Automated testing remove this fear, makes refactoring much easier, in turn making code more readable and easier to maintain. • Bottom line – maintenance becomes much easier and cheaper. The time spent writing unit tests might be costly now – but the time it saves you down the road has been proven time and time again to be far more valuable. This is the 1 reason to automate testing your code. It gives us confidence that allows us to take on more ambitious changes to systems that we might have otherwise had to reduce requirements on, or maybe even not take on at all. strongTerminology Review/strong • Unit testing - testing the lowest level, single unit of work. E.G. – test all possible code paths that a single function can flow through. • Integration testing - testing how your units work together. E.g. – run a ‘job’ (or series of function calls) that does a bunch of work, with known inputs - and then query the database at the end and assert the values are what you expect from those known inputs (instead of having to eye-ball a grid on a web page somewhere, e.g. doing a functional test).  • Fakes – a fake is a type of object whose purpose is to use for your testing. It allows you too easily emnot/em test code that you do not want to test. Instead of having to call code that you do not want – like a database call – you use a fake object to ‘fake’ that DB call and perhaps read the data from an XML/Excel file or a mocking framework. o Mock – a type of fake to which you make assert statements against. o Stub – a type of fake to which you use as placeholder code, so you can skip the database call, but do not make asserts against strongemLessons/em/strong strongLesson one – Hello Worlds/strong • Hello World unit test - I will create a ‘hello world’ console application that is unit tested. Will create this application on the fly during the meeting, showing the tools in Visual Studio 2008 (test-project, test tools toolbar, etc.) that we are going to use along the way while explaining what they do. This will have only a single unit-test. (OK, maybe I won’t create it ‘on the fly’ =), have to think about it more). Will also explain the Assert class and its purpose and the general flow of a unit-test. • Hello World, a bit more complicated. Now our function has different paths/logical branches the code can flow through. We will have ~3 unit tests for this function. This will be a pre-written solution I make before the meeting. • Hello World, dependency injection. (Not using any DI frameworks). A pre-written solution that builds off the previous one, this time using dependency injection. Will explain what DI is and show a sample of how it works. • Hello World, Mock Objects. A pre-written solution that builds off the previous one, this time using our newly added DI code to inject a mock object into our class to show how mocking works. Will use NMock2.0 as this is the only one I have exposure to. Very simple emple to just display the use of mock objects. (Perhaps put this one in a separate lesson?). • Hello World, (non-automated) Integration Test. Building off the previous solution, we create an integration test so show how to test 2 functions together, or entire class together (perhaps put this one in a separate lesson?) strongLesson two – now we know the basics – how to apply this in real life?/strong • General overview of best practices o Rule 1- Single Responsibility Principal. Single Responsibility Principal. Single Responsibility Principal. Facetiously stating that this is the single most important thing to keep in mind while writing your code. A class should have only one purpose; a function should do only one thing. The key word here is ‘unit’ test – and the SRP will keep your classes  amp; functions encapsulated into units. o Dependency Injection is your second best friend. DI allows you to ‘plug’ behavior into classes you have, at run time. Among other things, this is how we use mocking frameworks to make our bigger classes more easily testable. o Always think ‘how will I test this’ as you are writing code. If it seems ‘too hard to test’, it is likely that your code is too complicated. Re-factor until it into more logical units of classes/functions - take that one class that does 5 things and turn it into 5 classes, one which calls the other 4. Now your code will be much easier to test – and also easier to read and refactor as well. o Test embehavior/em, not implementation. In nutshell, this means that we can for the most part test only the Public functions on our classes. We don’t care about testing the private ones (implementation), because the public ones (behavior) are what our calling code uses. For emple... I’m a millionaire software developer and go to the Aston Martin dealership to buy myself a brand new DB9. The sales guy tells me that it can do 0-60 in 3 seconds. How would you test this? Would you lift the engine out and perform diagnostics tests, etc..? No... You would take it onto the parkway and do 160 MPH =). This is testing behavior vs. implementation. • Reviewing a real life unit-tested application. Here we will go over each of the above ‘hello world’ emples – but the real life versions, using my most recent project as an emple. I'll open a simple unit test, a more complex one, one that uses DI, and one that uses Mocks (probably coupled to the DI one). This project is fairly small  amp; simple so it is really a perfect fit. This will also include testing the DAL and how to setup a test database to run these tests against.  ",1,test,3,1,test,3

13660154,Best table structure for users with different roles,"We are working on a website which will feature about 5 different user roles, each with different properties. In the current version of the database schema we have a single emusers/em table which holds all the users, and all of their properties. The problem is that the properties that we need differ per user role. All users have the same basis properties, like a name, e-mail address and password. But on top of that the properties differ per role. Some have social media links, others have invoice addresses, etc. In total there may be up to 60 columns (properties), of which only a portion are used by each user role. In total we may have about 250,000 users in the table, of which the biggest portion (about 220,000) will be of a single user role (and use about 20 of the 60 columns). The other 30,000 users are divided over four other rules and use a sub-set of the other 40 columns. What is the best database structure for this, both from a DB as a development perspective? My idea is to have a base emusers/em table, and then extend on that with tables like emusers/em_ emmoderators/em, but this may lead to a lot of JOIN'ed queries. A way to prevent this is by using VIEWs, but I've read some (out-dated?) articles that VIEWs may hurt performance, like: a href=http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/08/12/mysql-view-as-performance-troublemaker/ rel=nofollowhttp://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/08/12/mysql-view-as-performance-troublemaker//a.

I've always had separate JS files for the various views in my app. Now, Asset Pipeline wants to combine all of those into one file.

18618954,sql triggers and technical debt,"My boss asked me to create a easier system for finding points by having points associated with the user table in our mysql database.

So my job was to add these all together and put them in a column. Now he says the problem is that there is still all the queries running around adding points, but instead of changing them to simply add points to the users column upon task completion, they suggested i use a trigger to simply add points to the users column, when one of the other columns has points added to it. To me this sounds like using a work-around and creating technical debt. Am i wrong?  Im new to the system, and i dont know ectly where all the queries are in the php pages, but if this is creating technical debt, what would be the appropriate way to fix this.

Thus I prefer to keep code clear and easy to understand (which basically means, implement things the way anyone would do it, try no fancy stuff until really needed). Though, when performance becomes an issue, it is good to know exactly where to look into and do the optimizations at the cost of loosing from code clarity.I would like to be able to mark the places where code can be optimized and give some hints on how though.The way I was thinking to do so is by using an annotation like: public class UserDao { @Optimizable (hint=cache returned data; ) public List  User   getUsers(int userType) { //some code getting user and checking if user is of that type. }}reIs there a standard - community wide used - way to mark your code for such?

That leaves me with three files for every class: all virtual base interface class, production implementation using all production parameters and mock implementation using all mock parameters. Is this the correct approach?
I only found simple examples, where function parameters are primitives, but not classes, which in turn need tests themselves (and may therefore require interfaces).",1,test,3,1,test,3
40979856,Managing complex prefab hierarchies in Unity3D,"I asked this question in a few places, and still haven't figured it out completely yet, so maybe some smart people here will have an idea how to approach that.What's the best way of maintaining a deep nested hierarchy of prefabs in a project? Say, we have a few GUI screens, made of smaller, generic components. For the sake of simplicity, let's call the former views, and the latter - components. Views deal with semantics (e.g. inventory view, store view); components are configurable, but have no business logic attached to them whatsoever (for instance, a button cares only about its OnTap callback/event handler).Both views and components can be nested.GUI views need to be reused across multiple scenes.The main issue with this approach in Unity is the fact that any nested hierarchy, once turned into a prefab, loses references to its children prefabs, like in this (completely made up, yet still valid) example:code- storeView - UIViewHeader - UIHeaderLabel  Text   - UIList - UIListItem - UIThumbnail - UITitleLabel  Text   - UISubTitleLabel  Text   - UIPrimaryButton  Button   - ...I'd like to keep all of these, small UI* components in separate prefabs, but also keep the storeView prefab so I can easily add it to different scenes. Unfortunately, as soon, as we create the storeView prefab, all of the UI* prefab references are lost.Given that, we could try a different approach, in which instead of having a storeView prefab with content, we keep it empty and pick one of these few options:olliattach a behaviour to storeView and load child prefabs during run-timeullicons: makes designer workflow more complex, puts the complexity in the script, which might be more error prone from the dev perspective toolipros: makes it easier to reuse the storeView between scenes, component prefabs can be styled, modified globallylikeep the storeView as an empty prefab, and reassemble it in every scene that requires itullicons: components need to be wired up manually, it's still easy to save the entire storeView accidentally and lose the prefab referenceslipros: guarantees that component prefab references are maintained, allows for slight differences between views (imho that's an issue actually, since these should belong to the configuration layer)lisave the entire storeView as a prefabullicons: scales terribly, makes iterating on new features or small UX changes more time consuming (additional QA, acceptance tests, etc...)lipros: it's a quick and dirty solution that works well with small projectsliuse Prefab Evolution or similarullicons: I assume the package will be rendered obsolete by Nested Prefabs, which are on the roadmap? Requires depending on 3rd party code and might not be flexible enough (any opinions here, guys?)lipros: From many (mixed) reviews I've seen, some have been quite positive. The more complex a project gets, the less positive these reviews are, however.liwrite a bunch custom Editor scripts:ullicons: time consuming, also - seems like something that should be provided by the platform, even if it deals mainly with gameslipros: complete control over the behaviour, can be improved by developers with designers' feedback. One might argue that being disciplined about having implementation, tests and designer-friendly tools as feature requirements sounds like a good design practice (resulting in less technical debt, easier maintenance)Here's my personal, v. idealistic, unrealistic solution to that*:/Use a componentised architecture, where child prefab references are stored in complex prefabs by default. Internally think of them as UIView and subviews on mobile (Cocoa), or component classes in React or better, functional components - React/Cycle/Elm/anything that goes well with FRP (yes, I know these approaches differ in so many ways, but the key is composability, achieved either by functional composition, decorators, et cetera, et cetera...).ullicons: I assume that my difficulties here come from my lack of experience with Unity and there's a more obvious, perhaps idiomatic solution (which I'm kindly asking for:) ) lipros: makes testing and iterating on new features way easier, makes prefabs way more powerful, whilst not losing any of their benefits (please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm still getting familiar with Unity)liplease don't think I'm expecting all of that from Unity, but that's one of the possible directions even if 1% of that is true.Just to make it clear, it's not a rant regarding Unity, as a developer working previously with mobile (native) and web, I find it impressing how many of my problems it solves, and how ridiculously simple some of these solutions are.",1,design,4,1,design,4
32229487,List all Classes WITHOUT Javadocs,Is there any simple way to analyze source code to list the number of classes that don't have any javadocs? As part of a technical debt exercise I want to list all these files and share the list out among the team to have the original authors write them. Note: We are using gradle as build systemUPDATE...So empty javadocs get created by default but our devs havnt filled them in much. Id like to be able to see all classes that dont have any description in the doc at class level. I dont mind about methods too much.,1,documentation,3,1,design,3
310010,Are there specific technical debts that are not worth incurring?,"There are (at least) two ways that technical debts make their way into projects. The first is by conscious decision. Some problems just are not worth tackling up front, so they are consciously allowed to accumulate as technical debt. The second is by ignorance. The people working on the project don't know or don't realize that they are incurring a technical debt. This question deals with the second. Are there technical debts that you let into your project that would have been trivial to keep out (If I had only known...) but once they were embedded in the project, they became dramatically more costly?",1,requirements,3,1,requirements,4
