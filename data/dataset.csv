316285,Shared Purpose tables in database design ( how would *you* implement a question/answer facility ),"I have long considered the design of a database that involves shared table purposes to be somewhat a trait of smelly code, and progressively increasing proliferation of smelly-code related problems.By this I mean, people over-normalizing, using 1 table where 2 tables could be more logical, people who've just discovered what normalizing is and overuse it to the point where they virtually layer a database on a database, or trying to use hierarchical data naively to solve all their problems. The question is, when you have 2 sets of data, which appear to be the same, but they have a different purpose, do you use the same table to represent it? When do you know when it is a good idea and a bad idea to use this? I've always been of the mind that needless self-referencing tables or structures that involved any table being used twice in the same query was a very dangerous predicament, both in design, and in long term performance and ease of future improvement.That was of course, until I saw a thing or two in the RSS feeds for SO here. Now I'm not going onto a meta discussion about how SO works, but there appears to be an implicit design consideration here that challenged my thinking and want to glean a more cohesive answer on that style of logic. You'll notice the generic question has the format:   /question/1234/stuff-here-that-s-safe-to-leave-outreAnd I generally assumed that this implied that questions were numerically ordered somewhere. But here is what stumped me:I'll take for example a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/316210question 316210/a. If you look at the a href=https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/question/316210rss feed/a for this question, you will note there is a entry for the question, and a series of answer entries, which are functionally identical for the question entry except for a few minor differences. Now note in the answer entries also have link references, ... to questions, not the same question however, but to different questions, such as a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/316218/question 316218/a, which , when visited, redirects you back to the original question. Now I'm not interested in emhow/em they implement that in the code, the problem is that you have here, questions and answers appear to be sharing the same table ( hence the sequential question ID's ) , and when users refer to an answer ID, you have to first query the database, and then go hey!, oops!, that's not a question! and then proceed to do a emsecond/em query to find out the parent of that question ( in the same table ) and then redirect you to the actual question page, not to mention all the hullabaloo required with self joining queries ( which I've always considered filthy ) and conditionals all over the place to tune behavior. Less Digressing, the real problem/The problem is, here you have 2 sets of data sharing the same table, and sure, this data is superficially similar, for now at least, but there looks like there is just so much technical debt involved. The long term considerations involved with implementing new features that can apply to questions and not answers and vice versa, not to mention avoiding one being interpreted as another in some obscure corner. You can't add a new column for use in one application set without having to consider the resulting effects in another. Sure, there is a minor benefit from using the singular table and that's when you emare/em making a feature that is shared between facets you only have to code it once, but this could be just as easily represented by using an ancestor class of common methods, and child classes that bind to the specific tables for the difference cases. So at least that way, adding a new feature has no follow-on implications for the other scenario. Now I've encountered this sort of problem in many places before, sure, but SO is the most easy example to point out.

I need this to be retrofittable to a legacy application as part of major refactoring (technical debt), so simplicity is essential of the used libraries. I do not mind having to do a bit of coding in our application, but it must be very visible what is going on. AOP has a tendency for moving stuff out of the way, and that may make the application harder to maintain.hrEdit: We have now reached the point where we actually need to make a decision. The application will probably live for decades so we need to make a reversible decision with a framework that will be maintained for hopefully as long. I really like the static type check available with Guice, but not that the annotations bind explicitly to Guice instead of being external like in Spring. I also like that code appears to be more concise when using Guice as opposed to Spring. We need something that is robust and helpful. We do not need more than just DI at the moment. Is there a use case that definitive says go for one of these?hrEdit 2011-07-27: The final decision was to use the JSR-330 API in code, and choose on a per-project basis if to use Spring, Guice or Weld.

And that's it. The optimization takes place when we somewhere else asks to find(T, x), now when we search the tree we will come to a leaf node, since x isn't inserted the tree yet (it only exists in the hash map M), we hash x and compare it to the keys in M to see if it is supposed to be in the tree. If it's found in M then we add it to the tree and remove it from M.This would eliminate the find(T, x) operation on add(T, x) and reduce it to add(M, x) which is O(1).

These ideas are usually based on belief that own framework will be much better than anything else available. How to deal with such ideas and how to explain that it is not always good way to go?Why I think internal frameworks / factories are not good:ulliBudget   Resources - There is usually only some initial budget to create framework. Nobody thinks about budget needed to maintain and support framework. Nobody can even estimate budget and resources needed for maintaing. At the beginning nobody thinks about maintaining multiple versions of framework to support already existing applications.liLack of experience - Framework is usually created by people without any such experience or with support of consultants - generally much more expensive people with similar skill set.liArchitecture / design - any architectural problem in framework affects all applications build using this framework. Bad design decissions in framework force developers to code applications in the bad way.liTechnical debt - bad code in framwork is technical debt.liFalse belief of silver bullet - managers believe that own framework / factory is silver bullet. All application will be written in the same way and it will be easily maintainable. My experience is that it is simple not truth. Even with SW factory each application is specific.liInsufficient documentation - documentation is first part affected by low budget. Framework without documentation is useless. Reflector (.NET) is my best friend.liInsufficient user group - internal framework has only small user group. Small user group means small experience. If I'm using public tool / framework and I have a problem, I can ask question on SO (or similar web) or just try to find answer on google. With internal framework it is not possible.liPolicy - company policy force you to use the framework to vindicate framework costs. This goes so far that the framework is chosen before the first requirement is gathered.liComplains to framework are prohibited.liUsage of other frameworks is prohibited.Why I think companies are doing this:ulliArrogance   egoism - sombody in company believes that he can do it better. liIgnorance - ignoring existing frameworks / solutions and the fact that only good frameworks survived long enough to be popular. Ignoring user group and already available informations on the Internet.liManagement failure and incompetence - not understanding the impact (especially long term) of this decission. Decission based on incorrect informations. Management without SW development background.I understand that sometimes own solution or framework for specialized scenario is needed but I'm tired with all these great internal frameworks for creating web or desktop applications.

4523197,"MongoDB tips, tricks and gotchas","I've used MongoDB (and tried MongoMapper and Mongoid adapters with Rails) for a few months now. I was previously deeply entrenched in SQL. Here are my observations:ulliThe lack of a schema and migrations doesn't mean you get a free lunch. Your application code will have to carry the logic and constraints that SQL schemas take care of. You'll have to be a lot more disciplined to manually migrate data, e.g. when you rename an attribute, or else your application code has to deal with multiple names for the same thing (in this example). This could easily lead to a lot of junk in the database and/or obscure errors. MongoDB is great because you don't have to define a priori what the stuff is you're going to store, and you can put entire arrays and object hierarchies into any attribute. In some ways that ease of use comes with a lot less safety, and I think we're still evolving a lot of the best practices around how to avoid building up a lot of technical debt here.liNo joins -- that means you kind of have to know your data access patterns (at least the ones that need to be scalable) when you design your collections.liNo transactions -- this opens the risk of race conditions if the same records in a collections are updatable from concurrent requests. For single-collection updates there are atomic operations, and these are particularly well supported and used by Mongoid (but not by MongoMapper).li16MB record limit for any record. Unlike codetext fields in SQL which can take arbitrary-size content, MongoDB has a hard limit of 16MB for any record.

8743937,Practical example of architecture using EBC?,"I was intrigued by Robert Martin's talk about ""Architecture: The Lost Years"". In it he discusses the Entity, Boundary, Control design pattern on which MVC is based. I love the idea of deferring architectural decisions. He described deferring the decision about how to implement the DB layer in his own wiki app FitNesse. I have organically deferred decisions like this in my own coding, though there wasn't a preconceived modular design that brought this about.I want to better understand this EBC architecture (which seems closely related to DCI) from a practical standpoint so that I can begin using in a small project. I want to capitalize on ""deferring decisions"" and the ability to swap out aspects of the design like the UI.Rails, for example, uses a form of EBC (MVC) but it's so heavily baked in that one could not easily substitute an alternate UI thus converting a Rails app to a console app or a desktop app. The intriguing thing about design for me is this ability to transform applications by swapping one thing out and plugging another in. That is, I wonder at the idea of designing an architecture so that one can, in a manner of speaking, swap out the UI or the persistence layer. I feel that if the architecture is well designed, the coupling will be low, and such a feat will be within grasp.I've ordered the book by Ivar Jacobson that Bob mentioned in his talk. I've search online quite a bit but all of the examples I've found show simple diagrams. I speak code. I would benefit more from looking over a few simple classes that demonstrate the concept and show how one might swap out one layer (UI, DB) for some other implementation through the use of boundary classes.If someone can't point me to a good resource illustrating this, would this be hard to whip up? Maybe we could use the standby example used in lots of software books: a video rental store (almost a relic these days). Please demonstrate how the UI or DB layer could be swapped. One thing that's confusing me is views. I can't tell from the diagrams I've seen if the views are the boundary classes themselves or if they just communicate with them. Also, Bob mentioned that the original intent of EBC was that we'd have lots of micro-views not a single macro-view (as we do in typical MVC); I'm curious what this might look like.

But now i'm at the part where i'm going to use models. Or actually, the model layer. But there's something that confuses me.
Alot of other MVC frameworks have a 'BaseModel'. I've read that this is actually bad practise, because the ""Model"" shouldn't be seen as another class. But as a real 'layer', which can contain things like the 'mapper' pattern or 'repository' pattern etc.
But to be honest, i don't see any advantages in that. To me, a 'BaseModel' class seems to be the fastest way to go, with the same results.
I can simply do something like:
<code>
But if i'd go for a repository pattern then i have to create the following: Repositories Entities DAO
Entities have Aggregates to other repositories. So basically i'm manually writing out my entire database scheme to objects...
In the end, what's the difference??? Except that i probably could have saved alot of time by simply using a BaseModel class...
But why is it still considered to be a bad thing then?? It's not that the repo pattern decouples my application more then i'm doing now. Because to me, those patterns mentioned above seem to be highly overrated. It probably would only work in an application that has a shared state; Save objects locally (in the repository) and commit them later on.
That's why i think no one can really answer this...
But i'm still hoping to see a decent answer that makes me go: ""ahhhh... What was i thinking...."".

From my experience, EF with its fluent linq-to-entities -functionality should be more than enough for pretty much all my needs.The most usual cases seem to start the repositories with methods such as FindAll, Find, Add and Delete, all of which are very easily accessible directly through EF (so no code duplication to speak of).So am I just missing some big point, or is the repository more for when you need to support multiple different data access technologies?",TD-related,architecture,"pattern, suboptimal_design",3,172,0.049,0.873,0.077,0.7314

It's a browser game with thousands of users online on an infrastructure that my boss refuses to upgrade and the machinery is running on 2-3 system load (yep linux) at all times. Anyhow that's not the real issue. The real issue is that some users wait until the server gets loaded (prime time) and they bring their mouse clickers and they click the same submit button like 10 - 20 times, sending 10-20 requests at the same time while the server is still producing the initial request, thus not updated the cache and the database.Currently I have an output variable on each request, which is valid for 2 minutes and I have ""mutex"" lock which is basically a flag inside memcache which if found blocks the execution of the script further, but the mouse clicker makes so many requests at the same time that they run almost simultaneously which is a big issue for me.How are you, the majority of StackOverflow folks dealing with this issue. I was thinking of flagging the cookie/session but I think I will get in the same issue if the server gets overloaded. Optimization is impossible, the source is 7 years old and is quite optimized, with no queries on most pages (running off of cache) and only querying the database on certain user input, like the one I'm trying to prevent.Yep it's procedural code with no real objects.

Upgrading MySQL is a separate issue that's outside the scope of both my influence and this question. What I do have control over is the PHP version that we use - and I'd hate to have to stop upgrading PHP just because we need to connect to some old databases.Updated (2):I updated the question above to reflect my new understanding that even PDO will no longer connect to these old MySQL servers.I should also clarify that we have several legacy applications accessing these databases, and we want to change these applications as little as possible. They are not in active development, and testing a change that involved rewriting large sections of code would quickly balloon into a rather large QA project.For this reason, invasive solutions such as rewriting the code or upgrading the MySQL version, are highly unlikely to be worthwhile. If they are the only solutions available, we'll probably end up doing nothing - using mysql_* as long as possible, and then freezing the PHP version (at least for these apps) as soon as the latest PHP can no longer connect.On the other hand, technically complex solutions (such as compiling something from scratch) are definitely possible, and are actually preferred to making extensive code changes.I'm now offering a bounty in the hopes of getting new answers that offer some more complex alternatives.",TD-related,architecture,"database, outdated",2,332,0.072,0.855,0.073,-0.1909

The whole point of Repositories is that the application shouldn't care what data source you are going to but without jumping through some massive hoops I don't see how these scenarios can be accounted for without the application knowing at some level FYI this is going to data source x so we'd better treat it differently.Is there a pattern or implementation that addresses this issue?

19724082,Restful authentication for non browser consumers,"I have a web service written as an ASP MVC application which basically uses rolling cookies as its authentication mechanism. So someone sends their username and password over https to the service, it then verifies them and issues them a cookie containing a token, user identifier and timestamp as HTTPONLY and SECURE. Then whenever the users need to access pages which require authentication the cookie is sent over and verified with the timestamp and the token against the user, assuming that passes it then issues a new timestamp and sends it back down to the user.This method works to date and although there are still possibilities of CSRF (reduced by the rolling timestamp) and a few other vulnerabilities it is a risk that the current project team are willing to live with, there is a big technical debt card to look into better ways, but thats for another discussion, as our main goal was a stateless service so it could scale easily.Anyway that all to one side, the issue now is that we have been asked to expose data to other 3rd parties from the service. They however wont be consuming this data like a normal user with a browser, but as an application of some kind on any sort of platform. So now I am wondering if there is some better way for application based consumers authenticate themselves, as currently they would need to send a http request to authenticate, then take the returned cookie, and send it over for restricted requests. However the other 3rd parties then need to keep juggling this cookie whenever they want to get data from our system, which seems a bit of a pain for them. So is there another way I cannot see to accomplish this? as the 2 ways I can see to keep it stateless are to send some token over on the querystring each time, which again would require them to authenticate and store it, and would make the querystring a bit less clean. Then the other way is as we currently do it using cookies as the state mechanism.",TD-related,architecture,interface,3,351,0.048,0.876,0.076,0.9007

24189753,Forking vs overriding,"I am working on a reasonably large and quite customised ruby on rails spree commerce installation. I am trying to decide how best to architect it so that I can keep upgrading spree without fear of it breaking my modifications.In the past I have followed the general spree documentation and made modifications by using decorators, overrides and sometimes overriding views completely. This works fine however there are two issues.1.) It can be harder to reason about the program when classes are opened up and extended via decorators. Its much easier if you can open up the file eg Spree::Product and look at the code and then work your way up the ancestors rather than knowing that in various parts in your system the class is being opened up and modified.2.) It can be hard to upgrade Spree if you go down this route. If you have overridden a view and it changes in the next version of spree you have no way of knowing. All you can do is upgrade and hope that one of your tests or manual testing picks it up if it breaks.The benefit of the above however is of course that its a very easy way to get started with modifications and if you are making few and small modifications then its probably fine.However are there better alternatives? One approach that I have been considering is simply forking Spree and making the changes directly in the forked spree codebase. I could then simply pull any new changes from spree into my forked repo when I want to upgrade. The advantage of this approach is that git will notify me whenever there is a change in a view that I have overridden. I can then merge this manually and either ignore it or take action.

29242469,Extremely slow and inefficient query execution from Entity Framework,"I've got Entity Framework 4.1 with .NET 4.5 running on ASP.NET in Windows 2008R2. I'm using EF code-first to connect to SQL Server 2008R2, and executing a fairly complex LINQ query, but resulting in just a Count().I've reproduced the problem on two different web servers but only one database (production of course). It recently started happening with no application, database structure, or server changes on the web or database side.My problem is that executing the query under certain circumstances takes a ridiculous amount of time (close to 4 minutes). I can take the actual query, pulled from SQL Profiler, and execute in SSMS in about 1 second. This is consistent and reproducible for me, but if I change the value of one of the parameters (a ""Date after 2015-01-22"" parameter) to something earlier, like 2015-01-01, or later like 2015-02-01, it works fine in EF. But I put it back to 2015-01-22 and it's slow again. I can repeat this over and over again.I can then run a similar but unrelated query in EF, then come back to the original, and it runs fine this time - same exact query as before. But if I open a new browser, the cycle starts over again. That part also makes no sense - we're not doing anything to retain the data context in a user session, so I have no clue whatsoever why that comes into play.But this all tells me that the data itself is fine.In Profiler, when the query runs properly, it takes about a second or two, and shows about 2,000,000 in reads and about 2,000 in CPU. When it runs slowly, it takes 3.5 minutes, and the values are 300,000,000 and 200,000 - so reads are about 150 times higher and CPU is 100 times higher. Again, for the identical SQL statement.Any suggestions on what EF might be doing differently that wouldn't show up in the query text? Is there some kind of hidden connection property which might cause a different execution plan in certain circumstances?EDITThe query that EF builds is one of the ones where it builds a giant string with the parameter included in the text, not as a SQL parameter:exec sp_executesql N'SELECT [GroupBy1].[A1] AS [C1] FROM ( SELECT COUNT(1) AS [A1]...AND ([Extent1].[Added_Time] >= convert(datetime2, ''2015-01-22 00:00:00.0000000'', 121)) ...) AS [GroupBy1]'EDITI'm not adding this as an answer since it doesn't actually address the underlying issue, but this did end up getting resolved by rebuilding indexes and recomputing statistics. That hadn't been done in longer than usual, and it seems to have cleared up whatever caused the issue.I'll keep reading up on some of the links here in case this happens again, but since it's all working now and unreproduceable, I don't know if I'll ever know for sure exactly what it was doing.Thanks for all the ideas.",TD-related,architecture,suboptimal_design,3,470,0.037,0.879,0.084,0.9646

The reason for this was because we developed a hybrid mobile app that integrates with our main application via these end points.The problem is that going forward we are not quite sure how to handle updates. If we update our API, e.g. we change the method signatures of the end point methods or we change the attributes on the DTOs that we return as JSON, then we would have an issue if our mobile users are running an out dated version of the mobile app.What we want to implement is something that will force our users to update the app if it is out of date. I have seen a lot of mobile apps that do this. So we thought of having an API version for our REST API and then have the mobile app check if the version it is using is the same as the version being run by our server and if not, then force the user to do an update.The problems we have are:We only have one version of our server running at any time. So how would we time our releases? What happens in the event that we release a new version of our API and our mobile app but the app store does not yet have the latest version publicly available. Then the user will be forced to do an update but the updated app is not yet available to them.How do we maintain the API version number? On the mobile app we can just configure that. But on the server it is not great to have to maintain a version number. The reason I say this is what if we make a change to a method signature or DTO, etc, and forget to update this version number manually before releasing? Surely there is a more automatic way to do this where some unique ""API key"" is generated based on the current definition of the API?

44232487,"Architecture: Dependency Injection, Loosely Coupled Assemblies, Implementation Hiding","I've been working on a personal project which, beyond just making something useful for myself, I've tried to use as a way to continue finding and learning architectural lessons. One such lesson has appeared like a Kodiak bear in the middle of a bike path and I've been struggling quite mightily with it.The problem is essentially an amalgam of issues at the intersection of dependency injection, assembly decoupling and implementation hiding (that is, implementing my public interfaces using internal classes).At my jobs, I've typically found that various layers of an application hold their own interfaces which they publicly expose, but internally implement. Each assembly's DI code registers the internal class to the public interface. This technique prevents outside assemblies from newing-up an instance of the implementation class. However, some books I've been reading while building this solution have spoken against this. The main things that conflict with my previous thinking have to do with the DI composition root and where one should keep the interfaces for a given implementation. If I move dependency registration to a single, global composition root (as Mark Seemann suggests), then I can get away from each assembly having to run its own dependency registrations. However, the downside is that the implementation classes have to be public (allowing any assembly to instantiate them). As for decoupling assemblies, Martin Fowler instructs to put interfaces in the project with the code that emuses/em the interface, not the one that emimplements/em it. As an example, here is a diagram he provided, and, for contrast, a diagram for how I would normally implement the same solution (okay, these aren't quite the same; kindly focus on the arrows and notice when implementation arrows cross assembly boundaries instead of composition arrows).emMartin Style/ema href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Zasg.png rel=nofollow noreferrerimg src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Zasg.png alt=Martin Style/aemWhat I've normally seen/ema href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLxNc.png rel=nofollow noreferrerimg src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLxNc.png alt=Not Martin Style/aI immediately saw the advantage in Martin's diagram, that it allows the lower assemblies to be swapped out for another, given that it has a class that implements the interface in the layer above it. However, I also saw this seemingly major disadvantage: If you want to swap out the assembly from an upper layer, you essentially steal the interface away that the lower layer is implementing.After thinking about it for a little bit, I decided the best way to be fully decoupled in both directions would be to have the interfaces that specify the contract between layers in their own assemblies. Consider this updated diagram:a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/62qSB.png rel=nofollow noreferrerimg src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/62qSB.png alt=Proxy Style/aIs this nutty? Is it right on? To me, it seems like this solves the problem of interface segregation. It doesn't, however, solve the problem of not being able to hide the implementation class as internal. Is there anything reasonable that can be done there? Should I not be worried about this?One solution that I'm toying around with in my head is to have each layer implement the proxy layer's interface twice; once with a public class and once with an internal class. This way, the public class could merely wrap/decorate the internal class, like this:a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFdAo.png rel=nofollow noreferrerimg src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFdAo.png alt=Proxy and Decorator Style!/aSome code might look like this: namespace MechanismProxy // Simulates Mechanism Proxy Assembly{ public interface IMechanism { void DoStuff(); }}namespace MechanismImpl // Simulates Mechanism Assembly{ using MechanismProxy; // This class would be registered to IMechanism in the DI container public class Mechanism : IMechanism { private readonly IMechanism _internalMechanism = new InternalMechanism(); public void DoStuff() { _internalMechanism.DoStuff(); } } internal class InternalMechanism : IMechanism { public void DoStuff() { // Do whatever } }}re... of course, I'd still have to address some issues regarding constructor injection and passing the dependencies injected into the public class to the internal one. There's also the problem that outside assemblies could possibly new-up the public Mechanism... I would need a way to ensure only the DI container can do that... I suppose if I could figure that out, I wouldn't even need the internal version. Anyway, if anyone can help me understand how to overcome these architectural problems, it would be mightily appreciated.",TD-related,architecture,"dependency, interface",4,678,0.062,0.857,0.081,0.9506

Specifically, I want to begin using Elasitcsearch, but still maintain a proper abstraction layer. However, the Elasticsearch API surface is huge. It exposes not only basic connection creation (which it easily makes sense to abstract away), but also extremely powerful (and therefore potentially complex) extension methods to build indexes and queries. In fact, it's so complex that it already comes with a built in wrapper layer for use in .Net: NEST.So my question is, is it reasonable to create another abstraction layer on top of that. Something like: public interface ISearchClient{ IIndexResult Index(IIndexRequest request); ISearchResult Search(ISearchRequest request); // Other methods here as appropriate.}reand then create extension methods to expose most of the power built into NEST? That seems like a ton of wasted effort given that most of the exposed functionality of the IElasticClient used by NEST is already extension methods down into the low level libraries. Is there a way to expose the existing extension methods handed to me by NEST? Is that wise to do, or does it defeat the whole purpose of implementing my own ISearchClient middleware? Or is the best course of action to create the abstraction layer and then only expose the existing extension methods as necessary?

But there are some questions I still have about it (they might sound stupid, but it's important to be as clear to newbies as the rules above):Should ViewModel be responsible for the business logic? I mean, since ViewController don't own models, it feels right to place the biz logic in ViewModel;Should ViewModel be a struct? This is a tricky one. I'm guessing ViewModel should also give an API to ViewController interact with data. Therefore, sometimes we need to use some escaping closures in order to fetch asynchronous data (e.g. HTTP calls). Structs can't hold it.Should I hide non-outlets variables from ViewController? Sometimes we need a  reference to some property in order to present views (e.g. keep the current page of an UIPageControl). Should ViewController hold this reference?How can I fire ViewController updates from ViewModel? I do read about reactive programming, but my question is wider: Sometimes ViewModel needs ViewController to respond to some actions, which is the best way to do it? Should ViewModel keep specific callbacks to specific reactions ViewController can handle?

Right now our web application consists of:A SPA written in Angular, deployed and hosted in an S3 bucket (Call it SPA)A webapi service, written in .NET Core, dockerized, and deployed to an elastic beanstalk application (Call it WebAPI)An integration service, written in Node.JS, dockerized, and deployed to an elastic beanstalk application (Call it IntService)The SPA and WebAPI talk via a REST APIThe WebAPI and IntService are loosely coupled and talk to each other through an AWS SQS Queue.If we have a change to any one of these services, our deploy process is fairly straightforward. For example, if we have a change to the WebAPI, we spin up a new elastic beanstalk application environment, deploy there, then swap the URLs (so basic blue-green deployment).However, I'm struggling with the right approach if there is a change that affects multiple services. For example, say there is a feature that requires changes to both WebAPI and IntService. Since each of these live in their own repo, they each have their own CI and CD pipelines independent of each other.If just one service is deployed, the whole app might break. How do people handle this type of deploy? Do you clone both the WebAPI and IntService environments, deploy both of them, then swap both URLs, just making sure you do it at about the same time to minimize the window of time where only one service is active?Alternatively, we were looking at using an API gateway. But would that mean every time we wanted to deploy we'd create a new API gateway stage? If we do that, is the blue-green deployment 'swap' actually happening in the API Gateway?Sorry if this is confusing, but I'm just trying to wrap my head around what I have to imagine is a fairly common problem with microservices.",TD-related,architecture,"duplication, suboptimal_design",5,359,0.033,0.938,0.029,-0.3632

Now could we simply introduce JobEntity as the RequestModel like so:JobViewJobControllerJobUseCase(JobEntity)JobEntityI know that doing like so will increase the fragility of code, because that way if we change JobEntity, then JobView has to change.

38062841,How to resolve circular dependency in Gradle,"I am migrating a Java project from Ant to Gradle. I think the best solution is to use Gradle's multi-project support, but I cannot find a way to get rid of a circular dependency.The original project was setup to have this layout: - project/ - common/ - product-a/ - product-b/reThe relationship between codecommon, codeproduct-a, and codeproduct-b is tricky. The codecommon depends on codeproduct-a or codeproduct-b, depending on a configuration file. Likewise, codeproduct-a and codeproduct-b depend on codecommon, regardless of the configuration property. codeproduct-a and codeproduct-b will never be built at the same time.I thought a quick solution would be to use something like this in the codeproject/build.gradle: project(':product-a') { dependencies { compile project(':common') }}project(':product-b') { dependencies { compile project(':common') }}reNext, I thought about getting a way to get this closer to working for just codeproduct-a. That led me to this: project(':common') { dependencies { compile project(':product-a') }}reThis will throw an exception for having a circular dependency.I've considered refactoring codeproduct-a and codeproduct-b by setting up interfaces of the classes expected by codecommon and codeproduct-aproduct-b or by using polymorphism, but before I move forward with either of those, is there a better way to accomplish this with Gradle?

748503,"How do you introduce unit testing into a large, legacy (C/C++) codebase?","We have a large, multi-platform application written in C. (with a small but growing amount of C++) It has evolved over the years with many features you would expect in a large C/C++ application:ullicodeifdef hellliLarge files that make it hard to isolate testable codeliFunctions that are too complex to be easily testableSince this code is targeted for embedded devices, it's a lot of overhead to run it on the actual target. So we would like to do more of our development and testing in quick cycles, on a local system. But we would like to avoid the classic strategy of copyaste into a .c file on your system, fix bugs, copyaste back. If developers are going to to go the trouble to do that, we'd like to be able to recreate the same tests later, and run in an automated fashion.Here's our problem: in order to refactor the code to be more modular, we need it to be more testable. But in order to introduce automated unit tests, we need it to be more modular.One problem is that since our files are so large, we might have a function inside a file that calls a function emin the same file/em that we need to stub out to make a good unit test. It seems like this would be less of a problem as our code gets more modular, but that is a long way off.One thing we thought about doing was tagging known to be testable source code with comments. Then we could write a script scan source files for testable code, compile it in a separate file, and link it with the unit tests. We could slowly introduce the unit tests as we fix defects and add more functionality.However, there is concern that maintaining this scheme (along with all the required stub functions) will become too much of a hassle, and developers will stop maintaining the unit tests. So another approach is to use a tool that automatically generates stubs for all the code, and link the file with that. (the only tool we have found that will do this is an expensive commercial product) But this approach seems to emrequire/em that all our code be more modular before we can even begin, since only the external calls can be stubbed out.Personally, I would rather have developers think about their external dependencies and intelligently write their own stubs. But this could be overwhelming to stub out all the dependencies for a horribly overgrown, 10,000 line file. It might be difficult to convince developers that they need to maintain stubs for all their external dependencies, but is that the right way to do it? (One other argument I've heard is that the maintainer of a subsystem should maintain the stubs for their subsystem. But I wonder if forcing developers to write their own stubs would lead to better unit testing?)The codeifdefs, of course, add another whole dimension to the problem.We have looked at several C/C++ based unit test frameworks, and there are a lot of options that look fine. But we have not found anything to ease the transition from hairball of code with no unit tests to unit-testable code.So here are my questions to anyone else who has been through this:ulliWhat is a good starting point? Are we going in the right direction, or are we missing something obvious?liWhat tools might be useful to help with the transition?

(I'm a pretty thorough tester and would test even if I read the code).This works for me and we have surprisingly (compared to most software I see) few bugs escape into the wild.But what I'm wondering is whether this is just the art side of coding. Yes, in an ideal world you would exhaustively read every bit of code that your change modified, but I in practice, if you're confident that it only affects a small section of code, is this a common practice?I can obviously see where this would be a disastrous approach in the hands of a poor programmer.

I want to be able to add rows to these tables from the C side of things. To accomplish this, I use an asp button that calls this method:<code>This works beautifully...for exactly one row. I can click the button, it adds a row. If I click it again, it doesn't do anything. More specifically, I suspect it's removing the currently added row, restoring the document to the 'default' state, and then adds a row (effectively doing nothing).Assuming I'm right, I need to somehow be able to append a row to another dynamically created row, instead of just replace it. If I'm not right, I just need a means to be able to continually add rows on a button press.How would I go about doing this?EDIT: I should specify, all this could be done in a loop, all at once.

I means I suppose as a pragmatic solution it might work but it feels like adding technical debt I'll have to fix later Other things I've tried is creating a new prefab with a new GameObject and a new FooScript and calling codePrefabUtility.ReplacePrefab GameObject newGameObject = new GameObject();FooScript fooScript = newGameObject.AddComponent  FooScript  ();fooScript.someValue = 789;Object prefab = AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath  GameObject  (prefabPath);PrefabUtility.ReplacePrefab(newGameObject, prefab, ReplacePrefabOptions.ConnectToPrefab);GameObject.Destory(newGameObject); // don't want this in the scenereBut that's not working for me.

I have tried various suggestions, mostly related to BOM issues, but I still get this 'BOM-like' error, when running from an executable jar file, that was exported from Eclipse. I don't get the error when running the code in Eclipse. The platform is Windows Server 2012r2The actual parsing is being done in a Groovy class using the XmlSlurper, whose input is an xml string passed from Java. I am assuming that the problem is in the Java code that creates the string. I got this error when I ran my first test in Eclipse. Eventualy, I checked the encoding in np++ (used to edit the file, but not create it) and it said UTF-8 + BOM. I changed that to UTF-8 rather than refresh my memory on handling BOMs, from some years ago. That solved the problem.When I export the Eclipse project to an executable jar, I get the ' Content is not allowed' parse exception from the same xml file (OK, it's copied to a different folder).I have tried using the Apache BOMInputStream to wrap the InputStream from the file (this worked for me in the past). This time it doesn't.The result from (BomInputStream) getBOM() is emfalse/em. But, it's also false when I set the encoding to UTF-8 + BOM! (that's running in Eclipse and the jar) In case it's relevant, the start of the Groovy code is: def ClientConfig parse (String clientConfigXML) { def config = new XmlSlurper(false, false).parseText(clientConfigXML);reI'd be delighted to find that someone can help. I haven't included the Java code as it's the normal stuff you find in Q A for this topic, and it's full of commented-out code right now.Time for bed...

54636985,Resolve Intermittent Performance Issue Due to Parameter Sniffing,"I've got a procedure exhibiting performance issues due to parameter sniffing. The procedure is costly but generally executes in an acceptable amount of time amid typical load. However, it will periodically perform poorly. When this happens, we see sessions executing the procedure go parallel. We'll see the number of sessions executing the routine start to pile up. We resolve the issue by pulling the procedure's plan from the cache, killing the active sessions, and monitoring for an immediate re-occurrence (like when a bad plan ends up back in the cache).The procedure is in a typical OLTP database (lots of small DML queries).When the subject query performs poorly, it causes a CPU spike and degrades performance of the associated service. During business hours, the procedure is executed more than 5 times a minute (don't have an exact count). The plan for the procedure is here: a href=https://www.brentozar.comastetheplan/?id=S1aEVQJBN rel=nofollow noreferrerhttps://www.brentozar.comastetheplan/?id=S1aEVQJBN/aAll columns in the query (join and projected columns), are covered by indexes.Here are the options I'm weighing:olliWe can apply Option Recompile to the problematic select statement inside the routine.liWe could do a little research and find a parameter value that generates a plan that is generally good for everything. We'd then add the following OPTIMIZE FOR to the function. This will incur a little technical debt as we may need to adjust this value overtime.liWe could introduce branching logic in the procedure. If the parameter value were X or in range-X, we'd execute sproc, and if not, we'd run sproc. Again, incurs a little technical debt.liWe could change the problematic statement to dynamic SQL. This will cause a plan to be generated for each unique SQL statement. If we get tons of unique calls of this procedure, it could bloat the plan cache.liSlap a MAXDOP of 1 on the problematic select statement.Options I've factored out:olliWe can optimize for unknown. This will change record estimates the density vector, and optimize operations for that.Have I missed any sensible options?

57508021,Postgres bulk insert/update that's injection-safe. Perhaps a function that takes an array?,"I'm working on paying back some technical debt this week, and it hit me that I have no idea how to make multi-value inserts safe from accidental or malicious SQL injections. We're on Postgres 11.4. I've got a test bed to work from that includes a small table with about 26K rows, here's the declaration for a small table I'm using for testing: BEGIN;DROP TABLE IF EXISTS data.item CASCADE;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data.item ( id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT NULL, marked_for_deletion boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, name_ citext NOT NULL DEFAULT NULL,CONSTRAINT item_id_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id));CREATE INDEX item_marked_for_deletion_ix_bgin ON data.item USING GIN(marked_for_deletion) WHERE marked_for_deletion = true;ALTER TABLE data.item OWNER TO user_change_structure;COMMIT;reI've been inserting to this table, and many others, using multi-value inserts, along the lines of: BEGIN;INSERT bundle up hundres or thousands of rows ON CONFLICT do what I needCOMMIT or ROLLBACK on the client sidereWorks fine. But how do you make a multi-value statement safe? That's what I can't figure out. This is one of those areas where I can't reason about the problem well. I don't have the appetite, aptitude, or patience for hacking things. That I can't think up an exploit means nothing, I would emsuck/em as a hacker. And, for that matter, I'm generally more concerned about errors than evil in code, since I run into errors a whole lot more often.The standard advice I see for safe insertion is to use a prepared statement. A prepared statement for an INSERT is pretty much a temporary, runtime function for interpolation on a code template. For me, it's simpler to write an actual function, like this one: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS data.item_insert_s (uuid, boolean, citext);CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION data.item_insert_s (uuid, boolean, citext) RETURNS intAS $$INSERT INTO item ( id, marked_for_deletion, name_)VALUES ($1,$2,$3)ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET marked_for_deletion = EXCLUDED.marked_for_deletion, name_ = EXCLUDED.name_;SELECT 1; -- No clue what to return, but you have to return something.$$ LANGUAGE sql;ALTER FUNCTION data.item_insert_s(uuid, boolean, citext) OWNER TO user_bender;reAll of that works, and I've tried some timing tests. I truncate the table, do a multi-value insert, truncate, do a series of function call inserts, and see what the difference is. I've tried multiple runs, doing the operations in different orders, etc. Both cases use a BEGIN/COMMIT block in the same way, so I'll end up with the same number of transactions on either test. The results vary more across tests than within them, but the multi-value insert is always faster. Congratulations to me for confirming the obvious.Is there a way to safely do bulk inserts and updates? It occurred to me that I could write a function that takes an array or arrays, parse it out, and run the code in a loop within the function. I'd like to test that out, but get flummoxed by the Postgres array syntax. I've looked around, and it sounds like an array of objects and a foreach loop might be just what I'm after. I've looked around, and this is a topic that has been addressed, but I haven't found a straightforward example of how to prepare data for insertion, and the the unpacking of it. I'm suspecting that I won't be able to use SQL and a plain unnest() because 1) I want to safe the inputs and 2) I might have functions that don't take all of the fields in a table in their input. To make things a bit easier, I'm fine with functions with fixed parameter lists, and array inputs with fixed formats. I'll write code generators for my various tables, so I don't need to make the Postgres-side code any more complex than necessary.Thanks for any help!Note: I got a message to explain why this question is different than my newer, related question:a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57517980/improving-a-function-that-upserts-based-on-an-input-array/5751975257519752Improving a function that UPSERTs based on an input array/aAnswer: Yes, it's the same starting point.

59098501,Using the results of one query to make another query and populate an HTML select,"Edit: will move this to the top to avoid confusion:I have no say or power of decision on the database's structure, so I must work with what I've got. Otherwise, as most comments stated this issue would be simplified greatly by normalizing and cleaning up the tables.hrI've got a database table which contains car models and some categories (national car, imported car, pick-up truck, van, etc). Something of note is that these categories are represented in integer codes.This table has 10 category columns for each row (Use1, Use2, Use3, etc), so each car can have up to 10 of them.Then I have another table which contains the descriptions corresponding to each category code (e.g. national car = 1, imported car = 2, and so on).I have a form which contains two HTML select elements, one for cars and the other for categories.   div class=form-group row     label class=col-sm-2 form-control-label  Cars  /label     div class=col-sm-6     select class=form-control id=car_model name=car_model onchange=fetch_categories(this.value);     option  Car 1  /option     option  Car 2  /option     option  Car 3  /option     /select     /div    /div    div class=form-group row     label class=col-sm-2 form-control-label  Category  /label     div class=col-sm-4     select class=form-control name=category     option  Select a car first...  /option     /select     /div    /div  reI need to populate the category select based on the value of the cars select. This is being done by using Ajax (part which works as intended and is probably irrelevant to the subject).The Ajax function sends the car data to a php script which successfully gets all of it's corresponding categories through a query.What I'm struggling with is using the results from that query to fetch the descriptions of all the categories that came from it through another query.I've tried doing a foreach to iterate all results from query 1 and then executing query 2 then formulating the code  option   tags, but I'm not getting it right.   ?php$car_model = $_POST['get_car'];$query = SELECT CodUso1, CodUso2, CodUso3, CodUso4, CodUso5, CodUso6, CodUso7, CodUso8, CodUso9, CodUso10 AS categories FROM cars WHERE car_model = '$car_model';$stmt = $pdo-  prepare($query);$stmt-  execute();$result = $stmt-  fetchAll();foreach ($result['categories'] as $u): if ($result['CodUso1'] != 0 || $result['CodUso2'] != 0 || $result['CodUso3'] != 0 || $result['CodUso4'] != 0 || $result['CodUso5'] != 0 || $result['CodUso6'] != 0 || $result['CodUso7'] != 0 || $result['CodUso8'] != 0 || $result['CodUso9'] != 0 || $result['CodUso10'] != 0) { $query = SELECT description FROM categories WHERE code = '$u'; $stmt = $pdo-  prepare($query); $stmt-  execute(); $result2 = $stmt-  fetchAll();?     option value=  ?php echo $u ?       ?php echo $result2; ?     /option    ?php}endforeach;exit;?  reThe resulting code  option   elements must contain the car code as value and the description as it's description.I apologize if the explanation is too convoluted, if you need any further information or clarification please let me know.Edit: example of var_dump from the first query's result: array(20) { [CodUso1]=   string(3) 101 [0]=   string(3) 101 [CodUso2]=   string(3) 502 [1]=   string(3) 502 [CodUso3]=   string(3) 305 [2]=   string(3) 305 [CodUso4]=   string(3) 406 [3]=   string(3) 406 [CodUso5]=   string(3) 103 [4]=   string(3) 103 [CodUso6]=   string(3) 508 [5]=   string(3) 508 [CodUso7]=   string(3) 455 [6]=   string(3) 455 [CodUso8]=   string(1) 0 [7]=   string(1) 0 [CodUso9]=   string(1) 0 [8]=   string(1) 0 [coduso]=   string(1) 0 [9]=   string(1) 0 }reScreenshots of tables:img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/GW9ous.png alt=Table 1img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/TFBa9s.png alt=Table 2Keep in mind these are the actual names of the tables and columns, I changed them in the above code for illustration purposes.",TD-related,code,database,1,546,0.01,0.961,0.029,0.8714

We want staff users to be able to view all orders and we want client user to only be able to view orders which relate to them.When attempting to view a particular record we make use of the following function in our OrderSecurity class: Public Function CanViewOrder(order) If currentUser.MemberOfStaff() Then CanViewOrder = True Else CanViewOrder = (order.ClientId = currentUser.ClientId) End IfEnd FunctionreAt points when we want to display a list of orders to a user we can the following function defined in a OrderService class Public Function GetOrders() If currentUser.MemberOfStaff() Then GetOrders = GetAllOrders() Else GetOrders = GetAllOrdersForClient(currentUser.ClientId) End IfEnd FunctionreThis is OK for the above but doesn't hold up well as the rules get more complicated. Say, for example, we add another user type which represents a less trusted staff member who can only view orders from a sub-set of clients. We'd then have to add logic to the CanViewOrder and GetOrders functions (and potentially in the data access classes) which in my mind violates the DRY principle.So, my question is: Am I missing a trick here - is there some way I can combine the business logic for permission to view orders in one place which both of these functions can use?Or am I worrying too much and should just get on and have the logic in two places?(In this particular application I'm using ASP Classic - don't hate the player, hate the game - but I'd be interested in how you solve this problem in any language)",TD-related,design,duplication,4,268,0.065,0.832,0.102,0.7343
1716563,Java/J2EE standard practices and design choices,"I have a couple of design/architectural questions that always come up in our shop. I said our, as opposed to me personally. Some of the decisions were made and made when J2EE was first introduced so there are some bad design choices and some good.olliIn a web environment, how do you work with filters. When should you use J2EE filters and when shouldn't you? Is it possible to have many filters, especially if you have too much logic in them. For example, there is a lot of logic in our authentication process. If you are this user, go to this site and if not go to another one. It is difficult to debug because one URL path could end up rendering different target pages.liProperty resource bundle files for replacement values in JSP files: It seems that the consensus in the Java community is to use bundle files that contain labels and titles for a jsp parsing. I can see the benefit if you are doing development with many different languages and switching the label values based on locale. But what if you aren't working with multiple languages? Should every piece of static text in a JSP file or other template file really have to be put into a property file. Once again, we run into issues with debugging where text may not show up due to misspelling with property value keys or corrupt property files. Also, we have a process where graphic designers will send us html templates and then we convert them to jsp. It seems it more confusing to then remove the static text, add a key, add the key/value in a property file, etc.E.g. A labels.properties file may contain the Username: label. That gets replaced by some key and rendered to the user.ol start=3liUnit Testing for all J2EE development - we don't encourage unit testing. Some people do but I have never worked at shop that uses extensive unit testing. Once place did and then when crunch time hit, we stopped doing unit testing and then after a while the unit tests were useless and wouldn't ever compile. Most of the development I have done has been with servers, web application development, database connectivity. I see where unit testing can be cumbersome because you need an environment to unit test against. I think unit test manifestos encourage developers not to actually connect to external sources. But it seems like a major portion of the testing should be connecting to a database and running all of the code, not just a particular unit. So that is my question, for all types of development (like you see in CRUD oriented J2EE development) should we write unit tests in all cases? And if we don't write unit tests, what other developer testing mechanisms could we use?Edited: Here are some good resources on some of these topics.a href=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/javabrary/j-diag1105.html rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/javabrary/j-diag1105.html/a",TD-related,design,coding_standards,2,479,0.043,0.923,0.033,-0.7189

3207611,Best Practices for Passing Data Between Pages,"The ProblemIn the stack that we re-use between projects, we are putting a little bit too much data in the session for passing data between pages. This was good in theory because it prevents tampering, replay attacks, and so on, but it creates as many problems as it solves.
loss itself is an issue, although it's mostly handled by implementing Session State Server (or by using SQL Server). More importantly, it's tricky to make the back button work correctly, and it's also extra work to create a situation where a user can, say, open the same screen in three tabs to work on different records.And that's just the tip of the iceberg.There are workarounds for most of these issues, but as I grind away, all this friction gives me the feeling that passing data between pages using session is the wrong direction.What I really want to do here is come up with a best practice that my shop can use all the time for passing data between pages, and then, for new apps, replace key parts of our stack that currently rely on Session.It would also be nice if the final solution did not result in mountains of boilerplate plumbing code.Proposed SolutionsSession As mentioned above, leaning heavily on Session seems like a good idea, but it breaks the back button and causes some other problems. There may be ways to get around all the problems, but it seems like a lot of extra work. One thing that's very nice about using session is the fact that tampering is just not an issue. Compared to passing everything via the unencrypted QueryString, you end up writing much less guard code. Cross-Page Posting In truth I've barely considered this option. I have a problem with how tightly coupled it makes the pages -- if I start doing PreviousPage.FindControl(""SomeTextBox""), that seems like a maintenance problem if I ever want to get to this page from another page that maybe does not have a control called SomeTextBox. It seems limited in other ways as well. Maybe I want to get to the page via a link, for instance. QueryString I'm currently leaning towards this strategy, like in the olden days. But I probably want my QueryString to be encrypted to make it harder to tamper with, and I would like to handle the problem of replay attacks as well. On 4 guys from Rolla, there's an article about this. However, it should be possible to create an HttpModule that takes care of all this and removes all the encryption sausage-making from the page. Sure enough, Mads Kristensen has an article where he released one. However, the comments make it sound like it has problems with extremely common scenarios. Other Options Of course this is not an exaustive look at the options, but rather the main options I'm considering. This link contains a more complete list. The ones I didn't mention such as Cookies and the Cache not appropriate for the purpose of passing data between pages. In Closing...So, how are you handling the problem of passing data between pages? What hidden gotchas did you have to work around, and are there any pre-existing tools around this that solve them all flawlessly? Do you feel like you've got a solution that you're completely happy with?Thanks in advance!Update: Just in case I'm not being clear enough, by 'passing data between pages' I'm talking about, for instance, passing a CustomerID key from a CustomerSearch.aspx page to Customers.aspx, where the Customer will be opened and editing can occur.",TD-related,design,coding_standards,3,588,0.073,0.779,0.148,0.9926

Unless you want a good giggle at someone's misfortune and gloat in your own awesomeness knowing that you would never leave behind such a monumental pile of crap for your successors.So, if you're sitting comfortably then I'll begin.In this app that I have inherited and been supporting and bug fixing for the last 7 months I have been left with a DOOZY of a balls up by a developer that left 6 and a half months ago. Yes, 2 weeks after I started.Anyway. In this app we have codeclients, codeemployees and codevisits tables.There is also a table called codeAppNewRef (or something similar) that ... wait for it ... contains the next record ID to use for each of the other tables. So, may contain data such as :- TypeID Description NextRef 1 Employees 804 2 Clients 1708 3 Visits 56783reWhen the application creates new rows for codeEmployees, it looks in the codeAppNewRef table, gets the value, uses that value for the ID, and then updates the codeNextRef column. Same thing for codeClients, and codeVisits and all the other tables whose codeNextID to use is stored in here. Yes, I know, no auto-numbering codeIDENTITY columns on this database. All under the excuse of when it was an Access app. These ID's are held in the (VB6) code as longs. So, up to 2 billion 147 million records possible. OK, that seems to work fairly well. (apart from the fact that the app is updating and taking care of locking / updating, etc., and not the database)So, our users are quite happily creating codeEmployees, codeClients, codeVisits etc. The codeVisits ID is steady increasing a few dozen at a time. Then the problems happen. Our clients are causing database corruptions while creating batches of visits because the server is beavering away nicely, and the app becomes unresponsive. So they kill the app using task manager instead of being patient and waiting. Granted the app does seem to lock up.Roll on to earlier this year and developer Tim (real name. No protecting the guilty here) starts to modify the code to do the batch updates in stages, so that the UI remains 'responsive'. Then April comes along, and he's working his notice (you can picture the scene now, can't you ?) and he's beavering away to finish the updates.End of April, and beginning of May we update some of our clients. Over the next few months we update more and more of them.Unseen by Tim (real name, remember) and me (who started two weeks before Tim left) and the other new developer that started a week after, the ID's in the visit table start to take huge leaps upwards. By huge, I mean 10000, 20000, 30000 at a time. Sometimes a few hundred thousand.Here's a graph that illustrates the rapid increase in IDs used.img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/90MBp.jpg alt=Take a look at his graphRoll on November. Customer phones Tech Support and reports that he's getting an error. I look at the error message and ask for the database so I can debug the code. I find that the value is too large for a long. I do some queries, pull the information, drop it into Excel and graph it.I don't think making the code handle anything longer than a long for the ID's is the right approach, as this app passes that ID into other DLL's and OCX's and breaking the interface on those just seems like a whole world of hurt that I don't want to encounter right now.One potential idea that I'm investigating is try to modify the ID's so that I can get them down to a lower level.

I originally intended to make the connection string available through broadcasting and subscribing to a new/changed connection string event, but because most/all of the 50 modules are loaded on demand they are unable to subscribe to the event during the login process since they are loaded after the login process. Based on my understanding I need a different approach to make the connection string available.I then thought about placing the connection string in the shell and attempting to expose it to any loaded module but I cannot find a way to do that without breaking the MVVM pattern and introducing unwanted dependencies.If anyone knows of a way to implement either of the above two options I would be very interested to know if it could be done while folowing the MVVM pattern.I am thinking now that the best approach would be to use some variation of a singleton for the connection string as a shared service. I would love for the Unity Container to be able to store the connection string and I could use a service locator to access it in any module but I do not know how to do this.

Foo is an object with a very small lifetime (~5 seconds), and can be created in any thread, any process, and at any time. I'm now extending Foo with new functionality, and a requirement is a function called FooInit() must be run before any Foo objects can be executed, and FooDestroy() when the process exits.The problem is, creation of Foo objects is arbitrary - any part of the code can, and does, call: Foo* foo = new Foo();reboost::call_once inside Foo's ctor works for FooInit(), but doesn't help me solve the problem of calling FooDestroy(). Referencing counting Foo doesn't help, because there may be [0,n] in memory at any one time with more to be created, so I can't call FooDestroy() when the count gets to 0.My current solution is to create and use a FooManager singleton inside of Foo's ctor.

This technical debt is starting to tax my project and I want to speed up access to this lumbering GIS database.Its a postgresql database with a postgis extension, controlled inside of rails, which immediately creates efficiency issues via the object-ification of database columns when accessing and/or manipulating database records with one or many columns containing text or spatial data easily in excess of 1 megabyte per column.Its extremely slow now, and it didn't used to be like this.One strategy: I'm considering building child tables of my large spatial data tables (state, county, census tract, etc) so that when I access the tables I don't have to load the massive spatial columns every time I access the objects. But then doing spatial queries might be difficult on a parent table's children. Not sure exactly how I would do that but I think its possible.Maybe I have too many indexes. I have a lot of spatial indexes. Do additional spatial indexes from tables I'm not currently using slow down my queries? How about having too many for one table?These tables have a massive amount of columns. Maybe I should remove some columns, or create parent tables for the columns with massive serialized hashes?There are A LOT of tables I don't use anymore.

One of the things I'm doing is introduce dependency injection, so that we can better separate the business logic from the data access implementation, and make it less painful to write isolated unit tests. I've gone with Simple Injector, but I'm having some issues.I've followed the a href=http://simpleinjector.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mvcintegration.html rel=nofollowMVC integration guide in the Simple Injector documentation/a. It describes the initialization process like this:olliCreate a containerliRegister types in the containerliVerify the container (optional)liOverride the default dependency resolverSo, here's the way this is implemented in the application so far. I've removed logging statements for clarity, and added marker comments for the steps above: // 1var container = new Container();var webRequestLifestyle = new WebRequestLifestyle();// 2container.Register  IOrganizationService  ( delegate { var proxy = new OrganizationServiceProxy( organizationServiceManagement, clientCredentials); proxy.EnableProxyTypes(); return proxy; }, webRequestLifestyle);container.RegisterSingle  ILoggerProvider  (LoggerProvider); // static fieldcontainer.Register  IExternalLinkRepository, ExternalLinkRepository  (webRequestLifestyle);container.Register  IQueueRepository, QueueRepository  (webRequestLifestyle);container.RegisterMvcControllers(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());container.RegisterMvcIntegratedFilterProvider();// 3container.Verify(VerificationOption.VerifyAndDiagnose);// 4DependencyResolver.SetResolver(new SimpleInjectorDependencyResolver(container));reThe above code fails on step 3 when attempting to instantiate the MVC controllers, throwing codeSystem.InvalidOperationException: An error occurred when trying to create a controller of type 'MyProject.MyNamespace.MyController'. Make sure that the controller has a parameterless public constructor.Which makes sense, because my controllers are set up for constructor injection. For example: public MyController(ILoggerProvider loggerProvider){ Logger = loggerProvider.Get(GetType());}reThe default MVC controller activator wouldn't know what to do with this. However, what I don't understand is why the codeContainer.Verify method of Simple Injector hits the default controller activator of MVC at all. Shouldn't the container innately use Simple Injector's dependency resolution to test the dependency graph? Looking through the exception call stack, it originates at codeSystem.Web.Mvc.DefaultControllerFactory.DefaultControllerActivator.Create, so it definitely goes outside the bounds of Simple Injector at some point.However, when I swap the order of steps 3 and 4: DependencyResolver.SetResolver(new SimpleInjectorDependencyResolver(container));container.Verify(VerificationOption.VerifyAndDiagnose);reIt successfully verifies the container, and dependency injection works as expected in the application as well. This seems to fix the problems for now. Still, I'm wondering:olliWhy does Simple Injector use MVC's default controller activator to test dependency resolution? Is this expected/documented anywhere?liAre there any side effects to setting the custom resolver first, then verifying? I'm asking because this is contrary to the guide found in the documentation.

I've done my research about async-await, but for me it is not an easy concept to grasp.

But in my experience sometimes behaves a bit funnily. The symptoms I've noticed are that sometimes it behaves like a thread that escapes my control. So the first question would be: what happens when you call codeMyFunction() and this function contains the codeasync keyword? My understanding is that (confusingly enough) it should not be called codeMyFunctionAsync() because that is reserved for functions that return a codeTask....so the alternative that I've come up with (that seems to behave like a synchronous class consistently) is this type of code: // CODE 2:public void MyFunction(){ var task = SomeFunctionAsync(); Task.WaitAll(task);}reSecond question: could someone explain the downsides (if any) of codeCODE 2?

Say, we have a few GUI screens, made of smaller, generic components. For the sake of simplicity, let's call the former views, and the latter - components. Views deal with semantics (e.g. inventory view, store view); components are configurable, but have no business logic attached to them whatsoever (for instance, a button cares only about its OnTap callback/event handler).Both views and components can be nested.GUI views need to be reused across multiple scenes.The main issue with this approach in Unity is the fact that any nested hierarchy, once turned into a prefab, loses references to its children prefabs, like in this (completely made up, yet still valid) example:code- storeView - UIViewHeader - UIHeaderLabel  Text   - UIList - UIListItem - UIThumbnail - UITitleLabel  Text   - UISubTitleLabel  Text   - UIPrimaryButton  Button   - ...I'd like to keep all of these, small UI* components in separate prefabs, but also keep the storeView prefab so I can easily add it to different scenes. Unfortunately, as soon, as we create the storeView prefab, all of the UI* prefab references are lost.Given that, we could try a different approach, in which instead of having a storeView prefab with content, we keep it empty and pick one of these few options:olliattach a behaviour to storeView and load child prefabs during run-timeullicons: makes designer workflow more complex, puts the complexity in the script, which might be more error prone from the dev perspective toolipros: makes it easier to reuse the storeView between scenes, component prefabs can be styled, modified globallylikeep the storeView as an empty prefab, and reassemble it in every scene that requires itullicons: components need to be wired up manually, it's still easy to save the entire storeView accidentally and lose the prefab referenceslipros: guarantees that component prefab references are maintained, allows for slight differences between views (imho that's an issue actually, since these should belong to the configuration layer)lisave the entire storeView as a prefabullicons: scales terribly, makes iterating on new features or small UX changes more time consuming (additional QA, acceptance tests, etc...)lipros: it's a quick and dirty solution that works well with small projectsliuse Prefab Evolution or similarullicons: I assume the package will be rendered obsolete by Nested Prefabs, which are on the roadmap? Requires depending on 3rd party code and might not be flexible enough (any opinions here, guys?)lipros: From many (mixed) reviews I've seen, some have been quite positive. The more complex a project gets, the less positive these reviews are, however.liwrite a bunch custom Editor scripts:ullicons: time consuming, also - seems like something that should be provided by the platform, even if it deals mainly with gameslipros: complete control over the behaviour, can be improved by developers with designers' feedback. One might argue that being disciplined about having implementation, tests and designer-friendly tools as feature requirements sounds like a good design practice (resulting in less technical debt, easier maintenance)Here's my personal, v. idealistic, unrealistic solution to that*:/Use a componentised architecture, where child prefab references are stored in complex prefabs by default. Internally think of them as UIView and subviews on mobile (Cocoa), or component classes in React or better, functional components - React/Cycle/Elm/anything that goes well with FRP (yes, I know these approaches differ in so many ways, but the key is composability, achieved either by functional composition, decorators, et cetera, et cetera...).ullicons: I assume that my difficulties here come from my lack of experience with Unity and there's a more obvious, perhaps idiomatic solution (which I'm kindly asking for:) ) lipros: makes testing and iterating on new features way easier, makes prefabs way more powerful, whilst not losing any of their benefits (please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm still getting familiar with Unity)liplease don't think I'm expecting all of that from Unity, but that's one of the possible directions even if 1% of that is true.Just to make it clear, it's not a rant regarding Unity, as a developer working previously with mobile (native) and web, I find it impressing how many of my problems it solves, and how ridiculously simple some of these solutions are.",TD-related,design,pattern,4,721,0.074,0.772,0.154,0.9968
43196496,Recurring tasks in .NET Core Console App,"The short version is - how do I (in 2017 having .NET Core 1.1 released) run recurring tasks in .NET Core console app with Microsoft's dependency injection?The long story and code snippets./The goal/I have 4 (and will have more) services each of which has say one method that performs certain isolated task and interacts with database. Specifically, I have one service that removes old data from database, one service that caches data (run through data in DB and stores aggregated results in other table), one that generates random data and so on... The idea is to run those tasks with different intervals, say every 20 seconds, or once a day. Current dirty implementation/I have a service that for each task has a codewhile(true) loop that spawns a service with DI, runs task, codeThread.Sleep(interval), checks exit condition (class-wide flag) and codecontinue/break. Most of the methods are codeasync.Current problems/First of all, I know that codewhile(true) and codeThread.Sleep(interval) is a huge hack (technical debt). Second, I have memory leak and I feel like the way I spawn/dispose service has something to do with it. Finally, the code encounters random errors and all exceptions are swallowed. I am not able to catch them in any known to me way.The solution I want/I want to achieve the goal, but if possibleulliavoid large frameworks, like Hangfire and Quartz.

Thus, we are left with an all-or-nothing situation. If we want something in-between, we currently have to use our build.xml file and write some custom code. This is painful because the metadata is not readily available.I would like to retain the use of the all-or-nothing flag but allow projects to selectively extract items - we have several projects whose build.xml files would be greatly simplified if we could knock the extraction process down to an attribute on the artifact itself.Thus, my thinking is to use an a href=http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.1.0/concept.htmlextra rel=nofollow noreferrercodeextra/a attribute on the a href=http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.1.0/ivyfile/dependency-artifact.html rel=nofollow noreferrercodeartifact/a tag to inject this information and override the codeivy.retrieve.pattern to search for this attribute.Ivy.xml   ivy-module version=2.0 xmlns:e=http://ant.apache.org/ivy/extra     dependencies     dependency org=my.org name=foo rev=${foo.version} conf=${conf.archive}-  * transitive=false     artifact name=megapin type=war e:expand=expand/     /dependency     /dependencies    /ivy-module  reBuild.xmlThis is where I think I'm having trouble getting the codeexpand extra attribute to show up.

One navigation graph per tab.It's layout, also very straightforward:   ?xml version=1.0 encoding=utf-8?    layout xmlns:android=http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android xmlns:tools=http://schemas.android.com/tools xmlns:app=http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto     FrameLayout android:layout_width=match_parent android:layout_height=match_parent android:background=@android:color/white android:clickable=true android:focusable=true tools:contex=com.mycompany.custom.navigation.NestedNavigationFragment     fragment android:id=@+id/nav_host_fragment android:tag=@string/nested_navigation_fragment_nav_host_fragment_tag android:name=androidx.navigation.fragment.NavHostFragment android:layout_width=match_parent android:layout_height=match_parent app:defaultNavHost=true /     /FrameLayout    /layout  reAlso using the recently added codeOnBackPressedDispatcher in use with codeapp:defaultNavHost=true, I have fairly good control over the navigation.Then, as you will see, the codeNavHostFragment will use the codeNestedNavigationFragment's child FragmentManager to display a nested navigation using nested (child) fragments. That's very important to keep that in mind for what will follow.Fragment Transaction - BottomNavigationView/I said I rewrote codeNavigationExtensions.kt. No need to show code, it's as simple as following.Upon selecting a tab, a single codeFragmentTransaction will...olliattach the associated codeFragment, if it exists, using codeFragmentManagerfindFragmentByTag or create a new instance and add it to the same codebackstack (same stack string name) ;liDetaching any previously added / attached Fragment, using codeFragmentManagerfindFragmentByTag while looping through codeFragmentManagergetFragments ;That's it.Using cached views/There we go, we finally get to my point. Thank you for bearing with me so far.As I got more knowledgeable with Fragments, especially with lifecyle (livedata) and navigation, I came to release that my fragments instance are saved (a behavior I was indeed looking for).So, instead of constantly re-creating my views, I kept a reference of them in order to re-display them in any subsequent call to my nested fragment codeonCreateView method.It worked quite well for a time until I had to implement an external library that exposes a fragment with it's own custom nested navigation (emyes, it gets that complicated/em - two-levels of nested navigation !).Hence the reason I decided to rewrite my codeBottomNavigationView's navigation.And there is my problem: upon re-attaching a previously detached Fragment, the content is blank. And, after working with background colors, I came to understand that using codeattach and codedetach do work as expected and does hide / display my codeNestedNavigationFragments, but their content is nowhere to be seen.Using the debugger, I came to realize that while my codeNestedNavigationFragments codeonCreateView methods are indeed called, the same cannot be said for the previously displayed nested (child) fragment!The solution I found so far (as stated in the intro), is to not re-use the same view of my codeNestedNavigationFragments. I have to re-create the view each time.Doing so caused the nested fragments codeonCreateView to be finally called and allowed them to use cache views ! Hourah !Hourah ... ? Really ? Well I suppose not, if, in turn a nested fragment starts using a nested navigation graph. That's what I happen with that aforementionned external library ! Thankfully enough, I am work on this library so I can fix this. And that's why I came here, to see if my logic is faulted.Conclusion/That's why, upon discovering this, I came to ask your opinion about re-using cached views of fragments.It does not seem to cause any issue with fragments that are not nested, but as soon you get nested fragments, all hell breaks loose.Is that normal behavior ? Did I do something wrong ? Is there a better way to that ? Some Fragment's view are heavy, and re-creating them would be too costly...Thank you for reading and looking forward to your thoughts and answer !",TD-related,design,pattern,5,774,0.036,0.906,0.059,0.8948

58648666,Layout Attributes within Styles,"I've been with a dilemma for a while that I don't know how to solve it properly. I want to use DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), but not apply bad practices in styles (such as set the layout attributes inside them).This is my case...To have the text styles encapsulated in my projects, I usually use the following:I have a style called codeWrap_Content   style name=WrapContent     item name=android:layout_width  wrap_content  /item     item name=android:layout_height  wrap_content  /item    /style  reOn the one hand, I have a style called codeTv that inherits from codeWrapContent:   style name=Tv parent=WrapContent     item name=android:fontFamily  @font/font_foo  /item     item name=android:textColor  @color/color_foo  /item    /style  reAs you can see, apart, the codeTv style has a default font and text colorIf for example I want to use a font size of 15sp, I apply this style:   style name=Tv.15     item name=android:textSize  15sp  /item    /style  reAnd so on...Well, the issue is that all the codeTextView of my project I set codewrap_content both width and height.Therefore, doing things like this simplifies the layouts XML a lot and it increases the readability and grouping common behaviors.Example:   TextView style=@style/Tv.15 android:text=@string/foo/  reAnd if in any case, I want to change any attribute, I have only to overwrite it from where I call it.The dilemma is that I am mixing codetextAppearance styles with codelayout ones. I have thought about separating this ... but I have not just resolved the main issue, that I am setting layout attributes on it, something that I should know nothing more than its own view, and not its container.But what does not convince me at all is to do something like this:   style name=Tv     item name=android:fontFamily  @font/font_foo  /item     item name=android:textColor  @color/color_foo  /item    /style    style name=Tv.15     item name=android:textSize  15sp  /item    /style    TextView style=@style/Tv.15 android:layout_width=wrap_content android:layout_height=wrap_content android:text=@string/foo/  reI don't want to repeat a million times with the same attributes if these are common. Or yes I see what it brings ... technical debt. Therefore, it does not seem like a valid option.I have searched quite a lot and the truth is that I have not found anything that convinces me and I would like to reach something elegant, since it is something that I use at all times and I don't like it.Well... what do you think about it?Thank you so much!!!hrEDITED 2019-11-08I have thought a new approach adding a new layer of styles, the code@style/TextAppearance. It is like this:   style name=WrapContent     item name=android:layout_width  wrap_content  /item     item name=android:layout_height  wrap_content  /item    /style    style name=TextAppearance     item name=android:fontFamily  @font/font_foo  /item     item name=android:textColor  @color/color_foo  /item    /style    style name=TextAppearance.15     item name=android:textSize  15sp  /item    /style    style name=Tv parent=WrapContent     item name=android:textAppearance  @style/TextAppearance  /item    /style    style name=Tv.15     item name=android:textAppearance  @style/TextAppearance.15  /item    /style  reThis add a little bit of complexity to the system, but it splits the layout and the textAppearance attributes.

Thus I prefer to keep code clear and easy to understand (which basically means, implement things the way anyone would do it, try no fancy stuff until really needed). Though, when performance becomes an issue, it is good to know exactly where to look into and do the optimizations at the cost of loosing from code clarity.I would like to be able to mark the places where code can be optimized and give some hints on how though.The way I was thinking to do so is by using an annotation like: public class UserDao { @Optimizable (hint=cache returned data; ) public List  User   getUsers(int userType) { //some code getting user and checking if user is of that type. }}reIs there a standard - community wide used - way to mark your code for such?

5798102,CakePHP and Rails: slowly port old php functionality to new rails,"I am a rails developer working on a cakephp site. The more work they send me, the more php code I write and thus the more dependence on php we introduce. What I want is to stop writing new features in php and start writing them in rails. Our resources are limited and the existing php site is huge so a full port from cake to rails is not possible.Is there some way to write new features in a rails app while maintaining and allowing access to all the functionality of the old php (and vice-versa)? It seems I would need a route aware app to traffic requests to either php or rails, but then we run into the issue of, for example, existing user functionality written in php not being available to the rails app and vice-versa.What about something to translate ruby into php? That way I could start writing my model stuff in ruby/rails rather than php.I feel like my question is muddled by the fact I do not know how to ask the questions I want to answer, so hopefully this is understood.As always, thanks in advance!",TD-related,infrastructure,"framework, outdated, td_resolution",4,190,0.016,0.896,0.088,0.9286

But the developer should only check locally his changes. So, why we are forcing the analysis in the developer build?

11333668,Extending/overriding System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient Send(message As MailMessage) method,"Scenario
Around 20 ASP.net(VB) applications share the same code framework and when deployed also shares a common web.config. Throughout the various applications we use System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient/MailMessage to send e-mails and now we would like to implement an e-mail opt-out feature for our users with a minimal amount of change to the existing code. That leaves out the simplest approach; inheriting a class from SmtpClient, say OurSmtpClient, and override the Send() method to remove all users that have opted to not receive e-mails, as that would mean we would have to change all New SmtpClient() to New OurSmtpClient() throughout the apps.
Alternatives
We've previously used tagMapping to remap tags to our in-house, derived alternatives, are there anything similar for classes so that all SmtpClient automatically becomes OurSmtpClient and thus will use the overridden Send() method?
We've also looked at Extensions, but the problem here is that we can't override existing methods, only add new ones?
Next alternative we have considered is reflection, but we couldn't get our minds around on how to actually implement it.
Events .. Oh, if there was a Sending event ...

This is typically used to check whether a variable hasn't been set yet or is still at initialization state, e. g. code-1.0 might be used for not yet set in cases where the value can only be positive.So, since these values are never emcomputed/em but only emset from constants/em, the Sonar complaint is not useful for us. Only for computed values (or fractured ones which are not precisely representable as floats or doubles) a complaint about a test for equality makes sense.The question I have now is: What is the best practice to change the code so that Sonar does not complain about this anymore?I see several options:olliExtract the test-for-unset into a special test function; but that would only reduce the number of occurrences (to 1), not the issue in general.liMark the code for Sonar to ignore it with a special decorator.

Then I would like to test make-deb and dh-virtualenv to deploy to a cloud server or Raspberry pi server. Then I want to run code to verify the download app works as expected on the server. Then I want to further develop the application and test deployment tools using make-deb and dh-virtualenv to see if I can more effectively manage development for production.Edit: Based on some further research so far it appears Anaconda cannot be made to export a requirements.txt file. It appears the options are to use virtualenv, make-deb, and dh-virtualenv; or to use Anaconda and Miniconda roughly as described in the following blog articles:a href=https://tdhopper.com/blog/2015/Nov/24/my-python-environment-workflow-with-conda/ rel=nofollow noreferrerhttps://tdhopper.com/blog/2015/Nov/24/my-python-environment-workflow-with-conda//aa href=https://www.thoughtvector.io/blog/deployment-with-anaconda/ rel=nofollow noreferrerhttps://www.thoughtvector.io/blog/deployment-with-anaconda//a",TD-related,infrastructure,deployment,2,238,0.02,0.92,0.06,0.8153

410719,Why does NotImplementedException exist?,"This really, really urks me, so I hope that someone can give me a reasonable justification for why things are as they are.NotImplementedException. You are pulling my leg, right?No, I'm not going to take the cheap stab at this by saying, hang on, the method is implemented - it throws a NotImplementedException. Yes, that's right, you have to implement the method to throw a NotImplementedException (unlike a pure virtual function call in C++ - now that makes sense!). While that's pretty damn funny, there is a more serious problem in my mind.I just wonder, in the presence of the NotImplementedException, how can anyone do anything with .Net? Are you expected to wrap every abstract method call with a try catch block to guard against methods that might not be implemented? If you catch such an exception, what the heck are you supposed to do with it??I see no way to test if a method is actually implemented without calling it. Since calling it may have side effects, I can't do all my checks up-front and then run my algorithm. I have to run my algorithm, catch NotImplementedExceptions and the some how roll back my application to some sane state.It's crazy. Mad. Insane. So the question is: Why does the NotImplementedException exist?As a preemptive strike, I do not want anyone to respond with, because designers need to put this in the auto-generated code. This is horrid. I would rather the auto-generated code not compile until you supply an implementation. For example, the auto generated implementation could be throw NotImplementedException; where the NotImplementedException is not defined!Has anyone ever caught and handled a NotImplementedException? Have you ever left a NotImplementedException in your code? If so, did this represent a time bomb (ie, you accidentally left it there), or a design flaw (the method should not be implemented and will never be called)?I'm very suspicious of the NotSupportedException also... Not supported? What the? If it's not supported, why is it part of your interface? Can anyone at Microsoft spell improper inheritance? But I might start another question for that if I don't get too abuse for this one.

Not necessarily at a create label or textbox, but we are pretty detailed... We also track our estimate to completion on all tasks, which I feel is a more important number than the original estimate when you're in the middle of the project.I think it comes down to the perception of the users and management.

738331,Does the Scrum process ultimately divest team members from their respective skills?,"My organization has been experimenting with the introduction of more ""Agile"" methods. We've been trying the Scrum approach for a short while, and most of the team has, more or less, adapted to it. I like it as a whole, but I'm concerned about one potentially severe impact of the methodology: as teams are consistently focused on features and backlog items, and testers are more integrated with the overall development process, it seems like skill sets are becoming blurred, and people are sensing less respect for their individual abilities.Some of our developers are excellent at server-side technologies and optimization of heavy-weight data provisioning. Others have invested a large amount of their careers learning GUI technologies and have developed a fundamental understanding of users and usability in an application. Neither skill set is better than the other, but they are certainly different.Is this an inevitable result of the Scrum process? Since everyone on the team (as I understand it) contributes to satisfying the next feature/requirement, backlog item, or testing goal at hand, the underlying philosophy seems to be ""anyone can do it."" This is, in my experience, simply not true. Most engineers (developers, testers, etc.) have a particular skill set they have honed over the years, and the Scrum methodology, in my mind, tends to devalue those very abilities they were previously respected for.Here's an example for clarification:If a sudden change of technology occurs on the server-side data provisioning, and every item on the to-do list for the sprint is based on this new change, the GUI developers (who likely haven't had time to become acclimated with the new technology) might not be able to contribute to the sprint. At the very least, they will need to invest time to get ramped up, and then their code will be suspect because of their lack of experience.I understand the need for rapid development to discourage ""role silos"" but doesn't this discount one fundamental reality: people develop skills in accordance to necessity, their interests, or their experiences. People seem to be less motivated when they perceive their position is one of ""plug-ability"" (e.g. we can ""plug"" anyone in to do this particular task). How does Scrum address this?

These include things such as spelling errors, and other single line fixes. To create stories of size 0.5 for every little thing seems like a waste of time. It takes more time to write the story and point it than it does to make the fix. If there were only one or two of these per sprint, it would be easy to just fix them and not worry about creating stories for them. However, if there are 10 or 20 or more because the application is large, this can start to add up to significant amounts of developer time that aren't being accounted for via Scrum. While it may be easy to say the QA staff and product owners should be more thorough before the original story is accepted in the first place, I'm the developer so that is essentially out of my hands.A couple imperfect ideas we've come up with so far:ulliHave a story that says 90% of bugs fixed in the app where you then guess how many bugs will emerge in that sprint and how many can be fixed and then point it based on the anticipated workloadliHave a story of size, say, 8 that is ALWAYS accepted at the end of the sprint where you fix as many bugs as you can.

But some stories became related or dependant on each other. We have stories that may take more if done first, and less if some other story would be done before them.QuestionsIs it possible to adjust story points later on during development, as we can do with story tasks where we can re-evaluate them, add new, remove existing or is this not the case with stories?

1557841,Misusing the term Code Freeze,"I'm just curious if the community considers it acceptable to use the term ""Code Freeze"" for situations where we stop development except for testing and fixing bugs.Development Situation We're just finishing up our third and final sprint, which will be followed by a ""Code freeze"" and 2 weeks of Q/A testing. It is a big release and some components development have transcended all 3 sprints. Historically even though we call it a ""Code Freeze"" we still commit code to fix bugs.Problem Every release I try and correct my manager and co-workers that we should be calling it a ""Feature Freeze"", because it's pretty obvious that we're going to find bugs and commit code to fix them as soon as we start heavy testing. But they still persist in calling it a ""Code Freeze"". Sometimes we still have known bugs and declare a ""Code Freeze"".The Wikipedia definition seems to agree with me hereAnalysis I suspect that calling these situations a ""Code Freeze"" is some sort of willful Double Think to provide false confidence to stake holders. Or we are pretending to be in a ""Code Freeze"" situation because according to Scrum after every sprint we should have a shippable piece of software and it is the expectation we are following Scrum. So we must call it what Scrum expects instead of what it really is.ConclusionAm I over analyzing this? I just find it to be unhealthy to ignoring realities of situations and should either give it up calling it something it's not or fix the root problem.

I know there have been Stack Overflow questions about which metrics are good to use - like this one, but my question is more about which metrics are useful to which stakeholders, and at what level of aggregation.As an example, my view is that code coverage is a useful metric in the following ways (and maybe others):For a team's own internal use when combined with other measurements.
For facilitating/enabling/mentoring teams, where it might be instructive when considered on a team-by-team basis as a trend (e.g. if team A and B have coverage this month of 75 and 50, I'd be more concerned with team A than B if the previous month they'd had 80 and 40).For senior management when presented as an aggregated statistic across a number of teams or a whole department.But I don't think it's useful for senior management to see this on a team-by-team basis, as this encourages artifical attempts to bolster coverage with tests that merely exercise, rather than test, code.I'm in an organisation with a couple of levels in its management hierarchy, but where the vast majority of managers are technically minded and able (with many still getting their hands dirty). Some of the development teams are leading the way in driving towards agile development practices, but others lag, and there is now a serious mandate from the top for this to be the way the organisation works. A couple of us are starting a programme to encourage this. In this sort of an organisation, what sort of metrics do you think are useful, to whom, why, and at what level of aggregation?I don't want people to feel their performance is being assessed based on a metric that they can artificially influence; at the same time, the senior management are going to want some sort of evidence that progress is being made.

2052101,Corp IT Systems direction. Invest in A or B?,"This is more of a general question about which direction would be a better investment for the company. Our company's core business application is written in Visual FoxPro and is about 9+ years old. The database is huge 15+ gigs and the core logic is complex and to make matters worse the data model is terrible. The two guys that built it and have maintained it all these years are at least in their 50's, so needless to say retirement or possibly death could come within the next decade or so.This VFP app drives all our core business functions and requires terminal services and citrix to access it from the outside world. Our web apps have to interface with it via ODBC and we are always having performance issues with it. The servers that run this system are also very old, like Win 2000 server and are falling apart.Recently we have been having meetings about upgrading the systems that run this core app as well as other services like email and file storage. The biggest expense however is buying new server hardware, OS licensing, Terminal Services licensing, Citrix licensing etc to solve some performance and outside access issues we are currently having as well as just generally bringing us to date on our systems. The price tag is going to be in the $55K to $65K price range. So as a web developer my point of view is that this is a huge waste of money! My solution would be to invest that money in rewriting the core system to run on the web based .Net platform. This would eliminate the need for Terminal Server and Citrix licensing along with the pricey hardware and configuration management to run it on. I don't see the point in investing this kind of money in an antiquated system that should be on it's way out anyways.I am looking to get some convincing arguments as to why this is a waste of money. Hopefully there is someone here that has faced this type of situation before that can give me some points of view. The hardware upgrade seems to be the easiest road to take because they will just have a consultant come in and do it all.

3505601,agile friendly way to integrate two separate applications/teams,"We have two distinct agile teams, each working on separate, but related, applications.brEach team has, until now, been able to work in an independent fashion (distinct code bases, persistence stores, sprints, backlogs etc). Recently, product management decided that these applications will become even more closely integrated. On a side note, the size of each team (comprised of QAs, Devs, BAs) will be increasing over the next 6-12 months.Management has decided to keep the agile process largely intact, since it has worked well (two teams working independently as much as possible) but have floated the idea of a contract-based service layer as means of integrating the applications. In each sprint, any story that requires integration with the other application will be identified. At that point, an additional integration story will be added to the other teams backlog. That team will then be tasked with fulfilling the contract. In the meantime, the other team can continue their original story work, substituting a mock/fake service until the other team produces a working service.Since Agile preaches a KISS philosphy, several people on the teams have taken issue with the complexity of this approach. They are advocating continued used of stored procedure sharing as a leaner/simpler integration methodology that has worked well in the past. I prefer contract based programming for all sorts of reasons, but the main reason is it's ability to provide compile time visibility into the behavior your application is expected to provide. You also get clear boundaries around who owns what code, and whose code you are likely to break if you break your contract. Stored procedures do none of that. Since we have already reaped many benefits from agile, I'd like to think that there is already an agile-friendly way to deal with this kind of app integration/synchronization.

Some we are not going to use.Are there good agile practices that I could add to the list?PS I can add a small description of the practices, if requested.EDITAs I said, we are already using some agile practices (mostly the practices that proves to be the best) :olliContinuous integration - this is very good practice. Getting the fast feedback on the latest check-ins is very useful. Having a down time because someone broke a build can be very frustrating, especially if it last longer.liSystem metaphor - it helps little, because having descriptive class and function names helps understand the code betterliCode standard - we created the coding standard before getting into the coding. Using uniform code style is good, because anyone can take another's code and work on it like on it's own.liTDD - before started coding, we set up the environment to easy create unit tests, but only until recently we started adopting the TDD principles. I personally tried it several years ago, and it didn't go so well, but now I love it. Unfortunately, not all team members are doing it - only half team.liScrum daily meetings - we tried daily meetings and they didn't go so well. As well as on my previous job, daily meetings usually turns into 30+ minutes discussions. I guess we missed good scrum master (or leader, how is it called?)liRefactoring - we did refactoring, but only if someone from the team creates a change request. We didn't do it like on purpose : Lets sit now, and reduce our technical debt.liSmall release cycles - right now we have huge release cycles (6 months), and for next release we are planing to break the cycle into 4-6 inner releases.liCode and design reviews - we did the initial design review (like 5 years ago), and few designs reviews of some minor sub-components during this period. We did code reviews of some classesliDocument late - we did it for this release. Only required documentation means writing documentation less and more fun coding. Developers are loving it :)liUse of design patterns - we are already using design patterns where appropriate.Because of the structure of our organization we can not use other practices, but as you can see the list is long, and you can not pick everything.Also, now we are only 4 SW developers, each maintaining approximately 80 kLOC and working on new stuff.

31520963,SonarQube 5.1.1 - Analysis very Slow with Oracle DB,"We want to use SonarQube 5.1.1 for analysing a Java-project with about 25.000 files. But the Step Apply project exclusions is very slow and takes 2.5 hours. Meanwhile the CPU-activity on the AIX-DB-Server is very high - 60% CPU.When starting SonarQube-Analysis (ANT-Task) in TRACE-Mode, we can see, that the following SQLs are executed very slow. Every SQL needs approximately 0.5 seconds. It seems, that this SQL is executed for each of the 25.000 files.I'm no Oracle-expert but it seems that the problem will be a full tablescan on the table project_measures for each of the 25.000 files.Any ideas on work arounds or solutions?I'm not sure if this is the same problem: a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31029254/sonarqube-apply-project-exclusions-very-slowsonarqube-apply-project-exclusions-very-slow/aLog from ANT-Analyzer (TRACE-Level): [sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.342 DEBUG - Opening JDBC Connection[sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.358 DEBUG - Resetting autocommit to true on JDBC Connection [jdbc:oracle:thin:@XXX:XXX:XXX, UserName=SONAR, Oracle JDBC driver][sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.358 DEBUG - Closing JDBC Connection [jdbc:oracle:thin:@XXX:XXX:XXX, UserName=SONAR, Oracle JDBC driver][sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.358 DEBUG - Load technical debt model (done) | time=16ms[sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.374 INFO - Apply project exclusions[sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.374 DEBUG - Opening JDBC Connection[sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.389 DEBUG - Resetting autocommit to true on JDBC Connection [jdbc:oracle:thin:@XXX:XXX:XXX, UserName=SONAR, Oracle JDBC driver][sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.389 DEBUG - Closing JDBC Connection [jdbc:oracle:thin:@XXX:XXX:XXX, UserName=SONAR, Oracle JDBC driver][sonar:sonar] 10:59:29.592 DEBUG - select metric1_.name as col_0_0_, measuremod0_.id as col_1_0_, measuremod0_.id as id5_, measuremod0_.alert_status as alert2_5_, measuremod0_.alert_text as alert3_5_, measuremod0_.characteristic_id as characte4_5_, measuremod0_.measure_data as measure5_5_, measuremod0_.description as descript6_5_, measuremod0_.metric_id as metric7_5_, measuremod0_.person_id as person8_5_, measuremod0_.project_id as project9_5_, measuremod0_.rule_id as rule10_5_, measuremod0_.rule_priority as rule11_5_, measuremod0_.snapshot_id as snapshot12_5_, measuremod0_.tendency as tendency5_, measuremod0_.text_value as text14_5_, measuremod0_.url as url5_, measuremod0_.value as value5_, measuremod0_.variation_value_1 as variation17_5_, measuremod0_.variation_value_2 as variation18_5_, measuremod0_.variation_value_3 as variation19_5_, measuremod0_.variation_value_4 as variation20_5_, measuremod0_.variation_value_5 as variation21_5_ from project_measures measuremod0_, metrics metric1_, projects resourcemo2_, snapshots snapshot3_ where metric1_.id=measuremod0_.metric_id and measuremod0_.snapshot_id=snapshot3_.id and snapshot3_.project_id=resourcemo2_.id and resourcemo2_.kee=?

By default, this would be the cacerts file in your JRE. If truststoreFile doesn't need a file use empty value.sonar.web.https.truststoreFile= HTTPS - the password used to access the specified truststore file.sonar.web.https.truststorePass= HTTPS - the type of truststore file to be used. The default value is JKS (Java KeyStore).sonar.web.https.truststoreType=JKS HTTPS - the name of the truststore provider to be used for the server certificate. If not specified, the list of registered providers is traversed in preference order and the first provider that supports the truststore type is used (see sonar.web.https.truststoreType).sonar.web.https.truststoreProvider= HTTPS - whether to enable client certificate authentication. The default is false (client certificates disabled). Other possible values are 'want' (certificates will be requested, but not required), and 'true' (certificates are required).sonar.web.https.clientAuth=false HTTPS - comma separated list of encryption ciphers to support for HTTPS connections. If specified, only the ciphers that are listed and supported by the SSL implementation will be used. By default, the default ciphers for the JVM will be used. Note that this usually means that the weak export grade ciphers, for instance RC4, will be included in the list of available ciphers. The ciphers are specified using the JSSE cipher naming convention (see https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html) Example: sonar.web.https.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384sonar.web.https.ciphers= The maximum number of connections that the server will accept and process at any given time. When this number has been reached, the server will not accept any more connections until the number of connections falls below this value. The operating system may still accept connections based on the sonar.web.connections.acceptCount property. The default value is 50 for each enabled connector.sonar.web.http.maxThreads=50sonar.web.https.maxThreads=50 The minimum number of threads always kept running. The default value is 5 for each enabled connector.sonar.web.http.minThreads=5sonar.web.https.minThreads=5 The maximum queue length for incoming connection requests when all possible request processing threads are in use. Any requests received when the queue is full will be refused. The default value is 25 for each enabled connector.sonar.web.http.acceptCount=25sonar.web.https.acceptCount=25 TCP port for incoming AJP connections. Disabled if value is -1. Disabled by default.sonar.ajp.port=-1-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ELASTICSEARCH Elasticsearch is used to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval. It is executed in a dedicated Java process. JVM options of Elasticsearch process Recommendations: Use HotSpot Server VM. The property -server should be added if server mode is not enabled by default on your environment: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html Set min and max memory (respectively -Xms and -Xmx) to the same value to prevent heap from resizing at runtime.sonar.search.javaOpts=-Xmx1G -Xms256m -Xss256k -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true \ -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75 \ -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError Same as previous property, but allows to not repeat all other settings like -Xmxsonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts= Elasticsearch port. Default is 9001. Use 0 to get a free port. This port must be private and must not be exposed to the Internet.sonar.search.port=9001-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE CENTER Update Center requires an internet connection to request http://update.sonarsource.org It is enabled by default.sonar.updatecenter.activate=true HTTP proxy (default none)http.proxyHost=http.proxyPort= NT domain name if NTLM proxy is usedhttp.auth.ntlm.domain= SOCKS proxy (default none)socksProxyHost=socksProxyPort= proxy authentication. The 2 following properties are used for HTTP and SOCKS proxies.http.proxyUser=http.proxyPassword=-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LOGGING Level of logs. Supported values are INFO, DEBUG and TRACEsonar.log.level=INFO Path to log files. Can be absolute or relative to installation directory. Default is   installation home  /logssonar.path.logs=logs Rolling policy of log files - based on time if value starts with time:, for example by day (time:yyyy-MM-dd) or by month (time:yyyy-MM) - based on size if value starts with size:, for example size:10MB - disabled if value is none. That needs logs to be managed by an external system like logrotate.sonar.log.rollingPolicy=time:yyyy-MM-dd Maximum number of files to keep if a rolling policy is enabled. - maximum value is 20 on size rolling policy - unlimited on time rolling policy. Set to zero to disable old file purging.sonar.log.maxFiles=7 Access log is the list of all the HTTP requests received by server. If enabled, it is stored in the file {sonar.path.logs}/access.log. This file follows the same rolling policy as for sonar.log (see sonar.log.rollingPolicy and sonar.log.maxFiles).sonar.web.accessLogs.enable=true Format of access log. It is ignored if sonar.web.accessLogs.enable=false. Value is: - common is the Common Log Format (shortcut for: %h %l %u %user %date %r %s %b) - combined is another format widely recognized (shortcut for: %h %l %u [%t] %r %s %b %i{Referer} %i{User-Agent}) - else a custom pattern.

41180132,"ASP.Net Web API vs WCF, which one should I choose in my project","I have read many articles in the web so far, about the differences between WCF and ASP.Net web API. Unfortunately I could not come up to a clear idea about what will serve my purpose. Most of the Articles I have read highlighted on the design point of view of the two web services. But I am confused what will work best for my project and why? Here is my brief description of the project.I need to create a communication channel between two servers (both are written in C). The servers will communicate using messages (certain type of commands). The messages sometimes can be only acknowledgements, and sometimes the messages may contain instructions to do some computation. For example, one message can be draw something, or send an SMS etc. And not necessarily the messages will involve any database transactions. But the messages can sometimes send large text files as payload (around 1-5 MB maxm). What I believe WCF is very will surely do this, but can I do the same with ASP.net web API. Because so far all the example I have seen for ASP.Net web api: they are good for RESTful services that manipulate some kind of DB store (GET, PUT, DELETE). But in my case I will need to expose service points that will block e do some kind of processing such as return the value of a computation, sending and acknowledging messages, etc. /block eNot just manipulating a DB-store.So, what should be the best and simplest way to do so? It is needed to be mentioned that I did not find any straight forward example of achieving this using ASP.Net web API.",Not-TD-related,Other,,,,0.053,0.842,0.105,0.9597

I just wanted to know what is the best way to build a custom data result set from a query using HQL or Criterias.Let's assume we need to handle these 2 entities to perform the following HQL request: SELECT m.idMission, m.driver, m.dateMission FROM MissionEntity mreThe Mission entity (simplified form): @Entitypublic class Mission{ Integer idMission; //id of the mission String dateMission; //date of the mission [...] //Other fields not needed for my request @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name = driver, referencedColumnName = id_user) User driver; //the driver (user) associated to the mission [...] //Accessors};reAnd the User entity (the driver) (simplified form): @Entitypublic class User{ Integer idUser; //id of the user [...] //Others fields not needed for my request @OneToMany List  Mission   missionList; //the missions associated to the user [...] //Accessors};reJSON output (first result): [ [ //Mission: depth = 0 (root) 1, { //Driver: depth = 1 (mission child -   User) idUser: 29, shortId: Adr_Adr, lastname: ADRIAN, firstname: null, status: Driver, active: 1 }, 05/03/2015 ], [...]]reAs you can see, I have a custom Mission entity result set (List) which the pattern for each Mission entity is the following: + Object - missionId (Integer) + driver (User) - idUser - shortId - lastname - firstname - status - active - dateMission (String)reBut for the purpose of my request I only need for the User entity its firstname and its lastname.So I need a result set like the following one: + Mission (Mission) - missionId (Integer) + driver (User) - lastname - firstname - dateMission (String)reAs you can see, I want to keep the same JSON tree structure: a mission entity own a child User entity but this time with a partial set of attributes (only the firstname and the lastname is needed in the set).For the moment, the only way to solve my problem is to use 2 additionnal POJO classes:The UserProj class: public class UserProj{ private String firstname, lastname; public UserProj(String firstname, String lastname) { this.firstname = firstname; this.lastname = lastname; } [...] //Accessors};reThe MissionProj class: public class MissionProj{ private Integer missionId; private UserProj driver; private String dateMission; public MissionProj(Integer missionId, String driverFirstname, String driverLastname, String dateMission) { this.missionId = missionId; { this.driver = new UserProj(driverFirstname, driverLastname); } this.dateMission = dateMission; } [...] //Accessors};reHere's now the request I use to get the wished JSON output result set: [ { missionId: 1, driver: { firstname: null, lastname: ADRIAN }, dateMission: 05/03/2015 }, [...]]reAs you can see, the result set is the one I was looking for! But my problem with that solution is that solution is not scalable. In fact, if I want to perform another custom result set for the User or the Mission entity with one additional field, I will have to create another POJO for this other custom result set. So for me this solution is not really a solution.I think it should exist a way to do this properly using HQL or Criteria directly but I couldn't find it!

I want to model two different types of users in the application: doctors and patients. They have some common attributes like name, email, telephone number etc, but the doctors have more specific attributes like collegiate number, specialities, studies etc.This is an E-R model (Hibernate approach) simplified without attributes.a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2A3G.png rel=nofollow noreferrerimg src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2A3G.png alt=enter image description here/aAs you can see, the relationships will become 1 to 1, but one of them will always be null.

My set-up has a core profile of 3.3 (GLSL 3.3, Mesa 11.2)and compatibility profile of 3.0 (GLSL 1.3, Mesa 11.2). I tried running some test applications using the core profile on my set up and was successful. However, I know for a fact that this application uses the 3.0 compatibility profile (uses ARB functions in the glext.h) but it keeps throwing INVALID_OPERATION errors (1282) whenever functions like glUseProgramObjectARB, glActiveTextureARB, glUniform1iARB get executed.Any help in solving this issue is much appreciated.",Not-TD-related,Other,,,,0.044,0.809,0.147,0.9144

I'm fairly sure the problem isn't in there, rather it looks like my package dependencies (I think).

In fact what does codeFailed: Can't resolve all parameters for ApplicationModule: (?). mean exactly?UPDATE:I have completely rebuilt the project from scratch using Angular 8.1 cli, and the issue remains. It seems clear to me that the problem is coming out of the test somewhere, because the rest of the project works as in the routing, the services, the components etc.I'm going to start stripping down the test to see where it breaks.UPDATE 2:OK, so even on the following minimal test, it breaks with the same error:pre class=lang-js prettyprint-overridecodeimport { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';import { PostContentService } from '.ost.content.service';import {BrowserDynamicTestingModule, platformBrowserDynamicTesting} from '@angularlatform-browser-dynamic/testing';import {AppComponent} from '../app.component';describe('PostContentService', () =   { beforeEach(() =   { TestBed.resetTestEnvironment(); TestBed.initTestEnvironment(BrowserDynamicTestingModule, platformBrowserDynamicTesting()); TestBed.configureTestingModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], }); }); it('should be created', () =   { const service: PostContentService = TestBed.get(PostContentService); expect(service).toBeTruthy(); });});reSo I'm thinking now that there's some basic issue with Angular 8 and jasmine testing, perhaps there's a circular dependency somewhere, or some other reason that we get this rather inscrutable error.

But for the past six months, most feature implementation fell under category 2). The system is mature, forcing me to refactor and test everytime I want to add new modules. Additionally, I find myself breaking things that use to work, and fixing it (I don't get paid for this).The client is starting to express frustration at the time and cost for me to implement new features. To them, many of the feature requests are of the same scale as the features they requested six months ago. For example, a client would ask, If it took you 1 week to build a ticketing system last year, why does it take you 1 month to build an event registration system today? An event registration system is much simpler than a ticketing system. It should only take you 1 week! Because of this scenario, I fear feature requests will soon land in category 3).

Our idea both scratches an itch, and seems to be something never attempted before.Our Issue:/We hope to follow principles from 37signals's book REWORK. A big part of the book is the idea of getting a product out early. It discusses why we should focus on the core of our product and that we should ignore all the extra stuff. Basically the idea of doing the minimal possible for a sellable product so we can ship and start getting feedback. We both have different views on what this means, and it is pulling us in different directions.I think the book is only talking about minimal features, but he feels it is about code design too. I think that some things are worth doing now to speed things up but he wants us to rush as fast as we can and skip those issues completely.I want to do some prep work because of the amount of time savings it would lead to later on. Like starting out with OO, Designing a thorough database schema, and spending time setting up stuff like a href=http://xcss.antpaw.org/ rel=nofollow noreferrerxCSS/a, and breaking down our problem into individual steps.[The way I understood him:] He wants to rush even emif it means writing horrible/sloppy code/em as long as it gets the design out the door. He doesn't want to get stuck spending time on basic code infrastructure or refactoring as we go or DRY principles. He doesn't want to spend the time to decide what needs to get done, he just wants to do it. He thinks that committing small changes to svn is just overhead, for example. I understand that he doesn't want us to get sucked into wasting time making a perfect system, but emI think this is going way too far, and isn't what 37signals is advocating./emIt's essentially a tortoise vs hare problem and I don't know how to explain to him that he will be shooting himself in the foot if he doesn't at least do some simple time saving code design choices, and break the problem down and work on it in small discrete chunks.He is a good developer otherwise, and is capable of doing it well.My Questions:liHow much prep is too much, how little is too little?liWhat high-payoff things should we be focusing on at the start of our project? liHow should we judge what is worth working on, code wise (not features), at this stage of development?liIs it worth spending the time implementing things like xCSS and other systems that would make it easier to write clean code from the start?liHow would you explain to him the value of fine-grain tasks and committing small atomic changes.liWhat things have you done with your code that havelead to a sooner ship time?

There are some 25 developers working the codebase. Total man years put into the product to date are roughly 150.The current codebase is a single project, built with ant. The high level goal of the project I'm embarking on is to modularize the codebase into its various infrastructures and applicative components.There is currently no good separation between the various logical components, so it's clear that any modularization effort will need to include some API definitions and serious untangling to enable the separation.Quality standards are low - there are almost no tests, and definitely no tests running as part of the build process.Another very important point is that this project needs to take place in parallel to active product development and versions being shipped to customers.Goals of project:ulliallow reuse of components across different projectsliseparate application from infrastructure, and allow them to evolve independentlyliimprove testability (by creating APIs)lisimplify developers' dev env (less code checked out and compiled)My thoughts and questions:olliWhat are your thoughts regarding the project's goals?

16790004,Should a 'Refactoring' Product Backlog Item count towards velocity?,"I have seen this problem approached in several ways by different teams.1) Technical debt items (like refactoring) are added to the product backlog as stories, with the user type as 'developer', and business value expressed as direct costs or ROI.This has the advantage of making the technical debt items (and their business value/reason for existence) visible to everyone, including the customer. It also makes the velocity including necessary technical work be accounted for and visible.However, they may be too technical for everyone to understand and may waste time for explaining and negotiating these items. The business value may not be apparent or explainable to everyone, especially those who are feature-focused.2) Reserve one 'special' sprint for technical debt issues.These are tracked on a technical backlog that is completely separate from the product backlog. This eliminates the need for the team to make the case for them, to push for technical debt items to be added into a business-value based backlog, or for these issues to be forced into user story form.Disadvantages: there are some in the community who are against any kind of special iteration. It also requires the customer (and everyone) to accept the productivity hit of a 'dark' iteration, in which no visible progress (and velocity) is made.3) Roll up the time necessary for technical debt into the stories.This allows the team to only commit to those items that can be completed without incurring technical debt.

I'm looking to upgrade our team into TFS 2013 and I've done tons of reading and research into how TFS manages work items, backlogs, iterations, tasks etc. And although I understand the principles of what 'can' be done, I'm having a hard time visualizing 'how' our team would work with these work items as tasks. If anyone knows of any best practice guides for actual sample based usage, or can answer any of these questions that'd be great1) Product backlog - Under the 'configure schedule and iterations' what is the concept for setting the current 'backlog iteration'? Our team uses short 2 week iterations with a build number, but setting the build iteration as the current backlog makes all new PBI's scoped to only that iteration. Any items not complete in that iteration would disappear once I set the current build to the next iteration number. On the other hand, if I set it to the parent root node, I could see the PBI list getting rather large over time. What is the best method for managing PBI's that are unassigned and working in a simple Parent-build1/build2 etc structure?2) Features - So I create a feature, perhaps it spans many work items and several tasks. They get completed over time, but I've noticed there's no 'auto' complete or status updates on parent items. So who/when is a Feature item supposed to get marked complete? If the product owner is supposed to use the features list to get an overview of work, they have no idea if all the dependent items have been complete and when to mark the feature Done.3) Work Items - Managing these, and in particular their 'state' or status seems like a royal pain. On the task board you can't change their state, only their tasks with drag-drop, which is nice. But you complete all the tasks, and the parent work item stays in status 'New'. Do you really have to micro-manage every work item, open it up, and set the state to Done?4) QA/testing - For every work item, each team member is responsible for testing each item, so every item is tested by multiple people, and logging any issues found. What's the best way to use work items or tasks for this? 5) Build Complete - Once every work item in the iteration is marked Done then I assume they are removed from the product backlog correct? The exception to this seems to be the features they were tied to, the feature item itself remains open. How do stakeholders view a list of features that were completed in the current build?",TD-related,requirements,"framework, outdated",3,458,0.029,0.882,0.088,0.985

Although the code already contains the issue introduced in previous commit.If Leak Period is set to a fixed date\version (A custom date or A version options), analysis will run for cumulative commits, and individual bad commits can squeeze through unnoticed, causing issues later in the cycle. So it doesn't satisfy immediate requirement.Imagine that after a fixed date\version there were 5 commits of the same size - 4 from good developers following TDD so with 100% coverage, and 1 from bad guy whose changes has 0% coverage. In average it will pass the default condition Coverage on new code is not less than 80%, but in reality we want to give feedback to such bad guys as soon as possible, so they improve their practices.If Leak Period is set to rolling Number of days before analysis, the state of the Gate will clear as soon as this number of days passes since the last bad commit, while issue could still be there in the code.We need to be able to analyze individual commits (similar to previous_version Leak Period option in SQ).But in case last commit passes QG and previous one failed, we should analyze them together to see if last commit actually fixes the problem from previous one, so that the project as a whole can be deemed as passed.So, in essence we should be analyzing all the commits since the last successful analysisThere is no such option for Leak Period.Is there any other way to achieve this?",TD-related,requirements,"software_methodology, td_documentation, td_resolution, metrics",1,409,0.137,0.75,0.113,-0.9599

Much of the UI code is in one large file (~3k lines).My preferred approach would be to first complete the refactoring on the existing Om code and split up the large file into many small files to make things more manageable and also restructure the files into a more intuitive file structure. After that, we would re-write the UI code using re-frame.My coworker would prefer to skip the refactor/restructure and write the UI code in re-frame.My thought process behind wanting to refactor first is that we would:ulliBe able to identify dead code and remove itliHave smaller, more organized files that would be easier to convert over to use the new frameworkliExtract common code that will be reused in the re-frame code so we have one copy of that common code that would be simultaneously used in Production by the Om code and by the re-frame code as it's being developedliDecrease the risk of project failure by doing one thing at a time (first the refactor and then UI framework swap)My coworker's thought process behind wanting to skip the refactor is that we would:ulliSave time and effort by not refactoring code that will be thrown outliTake advantage of the fact that we are in a lull period in between large projects to complete the UI framework swap, before we eventually get busy again and won't have time to address large technical debtI feel like my preferred approach is possibly slower but less risky.

I'm using a connection string like the following:
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/BigSense?useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=UTC
I insert the date using the following:
stmt.setTimestamp(x, s, Calendar.getInstance(TimeZone.getTimeZone(""UTC"")))
And the date does correctly get stored in MySQL in a DateTime column in UTC time. I can do a SELECT from the console and see it in the time format I sent it to the server as. The trouble is when I do a <code>
It's old Scala code, so don't judge me. I realize I shouldn't be using a retval and there are more ""Scala"" ways to write this :)
Anyway, I've tried variation where I check to see if it's specifically the ""time"" column and use getTimestamp instead, both with and without the Calendar object option and I still get the time translated to local!
This is for the BigSense project where I'm trying to support multiple databases (currently have Postgres and MS SQL fully supported) and so I'm trying to keep the code as generic/agnostic as possible. The full source for my DB stuff can be found here:

noTimezoneConversionForTimeType=true

In my case specifically, I have an app that uses KineticJS for several GUI components that need to be responsive or high frame rate. I'm also using WebAudio and reqAnimFrame, both of which assume things about the execution lifecycle (or, well, my code assumes things in how it schedules these). Are such things going to be impossible, difficult, easy to integrate with a Sencha app?Longer versionI am investigating Sencha, having become frustrated with the patchwork approach to JS libraries in a hybrid app. I now have an app that has some impressive functionality but is starting to feel like it cannot stretch beyond refined prototype, as the available libraries add so much technical debt integrating and wrestling to get them to do what I want. GUI In particular is very difficult. What I'm wanting is just proving too cumbersome using tools focused on general purpose web apps. HTML declarative widgets and layout, lots of CSS, external SVG, custom canvas components... Hybrid apps are Frankenstein monsters, at least if they go beyond typical CRUD apps with list views and standard mobile UI (and often even then).Sencha clearly is very robust, mature, and capable -- potentially a good investment for future projects. However I desperately am trying to get this current project back on track, where I can focus on adding features and less on the plumbing. I'd emhappily/em invest a few weeks just getting up to speed with a new (to me) technology like Sencha if I knew it would be possible and not prohibitively difficult to integrate my existing code, or (and I'm not seeing this), if there is some Sencha-preferred way to do high-performance rendering and scheduling. Hopefully this question is clear and not perceived as subjective. I believe it's an objective question (maybe not absolute emyes/em or emno/em), but requires some real experience with Sencha to be able to answer.",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.049,0.821,0.13,0.9789

27064718,Feature Flagging vs Authorization,"I just stumbled across the concept of feature flagging, and a popular open source Java lib for this called Togglz, which quotes a Martin Fowler blog post:The basic idea is to have a configuration file that defines a bunch of toggles for various features you have pending. The running application then uses these toggles in order to decide whether or not to show the new feature.But to me, this really sounds like authorization: Is the user authorized to view this content?For example, Should the user be able to see the FizzBuzz menu, or not?In Togglz I might implement this check like so:if(MyFeatures.ShowFizzBuzz.isActive()) {// Show the FizzBuzz menu.}In, say, Apache Shiro, I could do the exact same thing:ShowFizzBuzzPermission showFizzBuzz = new ShowFizzBuzzPermission();if(currentUser.isPermitted(showFizzBuzz) {// Show the FizzBuzz menu.}Again, feature flagging just feels like its the same exact problem as role- or permission-checking.I'm sure I'm wrong, but I don't see how. So I ask: How is feature flagging different than authorization and role/permission checking, and what types of concrete use cases exemplify this difference? In other words: When should I use authorization/role/permission checking, and when should I use feature flags?",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.038,0.879,0.083,0.8447

and metric_id in (N'3',N'53',N'185')) reThis lead me to execute select count(*) from sonar.snapshotsre= 16003Which I find to be a very high number?What is also interesting is that rendering the dashboard for a new project (about a month of analysis) takes half the time of a project that has been analysed for a couple of years now. We have about 20-30 projects, but only a few of them are really active. I would say only about 3-4 active projects. The rest are only analysed approx 5-10 times a year, so these projects should not really accumulate snapshots. The developers on the team are getting frustrated by the page loading time, so any help on tuning this is much appreciated!Is there a way of cleaning the Sonar DB for all history?UpdateThe dashboard containsulliscale ratinglitechnical debtlidir tangle indedliunit testsliintegrations testslicomplexitylidocumentationlilines of codeliduplicationslifalse positivesliquality gatelimost violated ruleslimost violated componentslihotspots by issueslitechnical debt pyramidlieventsliissueslimy unresolved issuesliunresolved issues pr assigneeliissues og metricslihistory table x 2liclirrliproject motion chartliproject file bubble chartI have created a more focused dashboard, containing fewer widgets. This has reduced the dashboard loading time by 50%, down to 10-11 seconds. Better, but also rather slow.

Groovy Version: 2.3.3 JVM: 1.7.0_40 Vendor: Oracle Corporation OS: LinuxI have project's with Java, Java + Groovy or totally Groovy based project.All of these projects have valid Unit and non-Unit tests (Integration, Selenium etc). I'm also running various static analysic tools for both Java/Groovy (pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, codenarc etc).For a Java based project, when I run sonarRunner (Gradle task) OR sonar-runner, I see valid data in project's Sonar dashboard for everything (including combined code coverage and other project health info). So, everything works for a JAVA based project.The same though, is not working for a Groovy based project. i.e. when I pass sonar.language=grvy for a Groovy based project and run Sonar analysis, I do NOT get Unit and IT test coverage as it says 0% coverage OR it doesn't even LIST those in Sonar project's dashboard but I successfully get project health info (issues, lines of code, etc etc). When I pass the above sonar language variable as sonar.language=java for this Groovy project, I do NOT see Groovy project's data info (issues, lines of code etc etc) and any code coverage info for Unit / Integration tests and their combined tests. I have valid jacoco exec files for both Unit tests and Integration tests (jacocoIT.exec is created after jacocoagent is attached to the target Tomcat JVM and after Tomcat instance is stopped).Any ideas! why sonar is not working for a Groovy based project OR for a project which has both Java+Groovy (source Java, tests in Groovy or vice versa or mixed). PS: I tried sonar.language=grvy,java OR sonar.language=java,grvy BUT, it didn't make any improvement on the project's sonar dashboard.emThe latest SonarQube version that I have (5.0) does support multiple language support/em.Sonar's emProject Motion Chart/em plugin also doesn't show any info as well even though Lines of Code is showing up at the right side (when sonar.languages is passed as grvy).img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/seHN3.png alt=enter image description hereWhen I pass sonar.language=java I get, here Project Motion Chart is showing nothing (not even a blank graph) says No Data.

So far no problem creating this in SQL.Only problem I have: for 2 projects, this information isn't stored at all in the database! In the GUI from SonarQube I can see this measure for each file, but than in the database these files have only 1 measures stored (technical debt).My guess is that for some strange reasons these measures are calculated on the fly for this project? Could that be? And is there a way to force SonarQube to store proejct measures for each file in the database? I tried with the sonar.analysis.mode=analysis parameter but that didn't work?Thanks a lot and regards,Pieter",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.095,0.887,0.018,-0.9146

Heres my request:   var contentArgs = { message: Auto TODO commit updating technical debt, committer: { name: TODO, email: tododebttracker@gmail.com }, content: bXkgdXBkYXRlZCBmaWxlIGNvbnRlbnRz, sha: fb617c9e42866ca2446545e0c2725048f6f9530c }; xhr.put({ // The URL to request url : url, headers : {Authorization : token 289543b6aca2454165451a1afcf115fa9a97}, content : contentArgs, handleAs : json, load : lang.hitch(this,function(result) { deferred.resolve({hasError : false, response: result}); }), error : lang.hitch(this,function(result) { deferred.resolve({hasError : true, response: result }); }) });reI've tried every possible variation of the contentArgs JSON and I have also tried using JSON.stringify on the contentArgs but having no joy. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.104,0.759,0.137,0.8752

30523430,The Sonar way to define a constant,"I use Sonarqube 5.1 and experiment with the “Sonar way” Java quality profile. The job is simple: I want to define a global String constant for a missing media type:public interface Utf8MediaType {String APPLICATION_JSON = ""application/json;charset=UTF-8"";}However, Sonarqube tells me this is bad practice in rule squid:S1214 – Constants should not be defined in interfaces. The long text talks about implementing this interface, which I didn’t intend to, but I give in and create a class instead:public class Utf8MediaType {public static final String APPLICATION_JSON = ""application/json;charset=UTF-8"";}However, this is considered to be a major design issue in rule squid:S1118 – Utility classes should not have public constructors. So it’s urging me to add a private constructor. Of course, this constructor has then to come first not to violate conventions in rule squid:S1213 – The members of an interface declaration or class should appear in a pre-defined order. I guess after that I might even get common-java:InsufficientBranchCoverage because the private constructor is not covered in tests.These are the default rules and I feel they are a bit silly in combination. I have more examples where the defaults just don’t work for us (TestNG support is lacking). What can I do about it? What do you recommend?Give in. Make it a class, add a private constructor, use introspection in the unit test. Makes the code ten times as big. For a String constant.Create a list of exceptions. But doing this for each project may lead to long lists and invites people to add exceptions even for important stuff.Deactivate rules. Now I would prefer not to tamper with the default profiles, because that may mean a lot of work on Sonarqube upgrades.Create a profile that inherits from the default and overwrites things. It turns out that when you inherit from a profile you cannot deactivate rules. You can only add additional rules and change the configuration of rules (to lower their severity).",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.021,0.906,0.073,0.9371

30624089,Import Jasmine test results into SonarQube,"I've encountered a couple issues when trying to display the passing and failing Jasmine specs in my SonarQube instance for a Javascript project. I use Maven to manage running the tests, via the very nice maven-jasmine-plugin, which provides a very simple setup for integrating with RequireJS and spitting out a JUnit-style XML report in my code/target directory. I'd like to use that report in Sonar.The first issue is that, if the tests are asynchronous, Jasmine reports a time of undefined for that test, which the Sonar Runner cannot parse, dying with an error:block e Fail to parse the Surefire report: Caused by: java.text.ParseException: Unparseable number: undefined Caused by: Unparseable number: undefined/block eIf I manually edit the TEST-jasmine.xml report to simply change undefined to 0, the report can be parsed, but then I get the following warning:block e WARN - Test result will not be saved for test class jasmine, because SonarQube associated resource has not been found using file name: jasmine.js/block eThis is on SonarQube 5.1 with the 2.5 version of the JavaScript plugin.I've seen some older mailing list and StackOverflow questions around proper Jasmine support in Sonar - is there any way to do what I want to do?EDIT Below is the debug log of the sonar-runner (with some files and names redacted): SonarQube Runner 2.4Java 1.8.0_40 Oracle Corporation (64-bit)Windows 8.1 6.3 amd64INFO: Error stacktraces are turned on.INFO: Runner configuration file: c:\Users\Tom\sonar-runner-dist-2.4\conf\sonar-runner.propertiesINFO: Project configuration file: c:\Users\Tom\Documents\  redacted  \sonar-project.propertiesINFO: Default locale: en_US, source code encoding: windows-1252 (analysis is platform dependent)INFO: Work directory: c:\Users\Tom\Documents\  redacted  \.\.sonarINFO: SonarQube Server 5.108:53:25.409 INFO - Load global repositories08:53:25.415 DEBUG - Download: http://192.168.10.157:9000/batch/global (no proxy)08:53:25.536 INFO - Load global repositories (done) | time=129ms08:53:25.537 INFO - Server id: 2015060816404808:53:25.538 INFO - User cache: C:\Users\Tom\.sonar\cache08:53:25.545 INFO - Install plugins08:53:25.545 DEBUG - Download index of plugins08:53:25.545 DEBUG - Download: http://192.168.10.157:9000/deploylugins/index.txt (no proxy)08:53:25.600 DEBUG - Loaded 2133 properties from l10n bundles08:53:25.600 INFO - Install JDBC driver08:53:25.600 DEBUG - Download index of jdbc-driver08:53:25.600 DEBUG - Download: http://192.168.10.157:9000/deploy/jdbc-driver.txt (no proxy)08:53:25.606 INFO - Create JDBC datasource for jdbc:mysql://192.168.10.157:3306/sonar?useUnicode=true characterEncoding=utf808:53:25.825 DEBUG - Testing JDBC connection08:53:26.389 DEBUG - Download: http://192.168.10.157:9000/api/server (no proxy)08:53:26.420 INFO - Initializing Hibernate08:53:26.421 DEBUG - hibernate.generate_statistics: false08:53:26.421 DEBUG - hibernate.dialect: org.sonar.core.persistence.dialect.MySql$MySqlWithDecimalDialect08:53:26.421 DEBUG - hibernate.connection.provider_class: org.sonar.jpa.session.CustomHibernateConnectionProvider08:53:27.391 INFO - Load project repositories08:53:27.392 DEBUG - Download: http://192.168.10.157:9000/batchroject?key=  redacted   preview=false (no proxy)08:53:27.564 INFO - Load project repositories (done) | time=173ms08:53:27.564 INFO - Load project settings08:53:27.892 INFO - Load technical debt model08:53:27.906 DEBUG - Load technical debt model (done) | time=14ms08:53:27.909 INFO - To enable the analysis bootstraper for Visual Studio projects, set the property sonar.visualstudio.enable to true08:53:27.909 INFO - Apply project exclusions08:53:28.200 DEBUG - Acquire semaphore on project : org.sonar.api.resources.Project@6e6b3dbf[id=  null  ,key=  redacted  ,qualifier=TRK], with key batch-  redacted  08:53:28.227 WARN - SCM provider autodetection failed.

We tried running the analysis first using Sonar runner v2.4 and then using the Sonar ant task v2.3 and both gave the same error.We found that there is a JIRA already raised about this: a href=http://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONARXML-3 rel=nofollowSONARXML-3/a but it has been closed as won't fix because it could not be reproduced on SonarQube 4.5.4.We did a clean install of Sonar 4.5.4 with version 1.3 of the XML language plugin onto a Windows machine and used a very simple test case.After the install we did the following:ulliCreated a custom rule based on the XML schemas should be valid ruleliLeft the schemas to the default autodetect and set filePattern to **/*.htmlliAdded html to the file suffixes setting of the XML pluginliActivated the custom rule in the Sonar Way profileWhen we ran sonar runner on a single html file we still got the same error.I have looked in the XML plugin jar and there it contains xercesImpl-2.8.1.jar in its META-INFb which contains the class that it complains it can't find.I am not sure what to try next.

31608933,Android Best Practices - Refactoring a big Activity class,"Looking to refactor a Google maps Activity class to something a little more maintainable.Currently it implements the following interfaces:codeLocationListener, codeGoogleApiClient.ConnectionCallbacks, codeGoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListener, codeAdapterView.OnItemClickListenerAs well as this, it contains quite a number of helper methods.I have a few questions relating to the best way of doing this.olliShould I create static helper classes and leave my listener implementations in the Activity class?liShould I create helper classes and create instances of them, passing to their constructors everything I need? e.g. contexts.liShould I abstract my Activity class and implement each listener in its own class separately?Thanks in advance. I'd like to follow some sort of Android/Java standard before my technical debt builds up much further.",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.031,0.757,0.212,0.9614
31748268,How To Configure SonarQube GitHub Plugin With Jenkins,"We are very interested in leveraging the GitHub integration on my team:a href=http://docs.sonarqube.org/displayLUG/GitHub+Plugin rel=nofollowhttp://docs.sonarqube.org/displayLUG/GitHub+Plugin/aWe use Jenkins as our CI Server and already have the GitHub Pull Request Builder working there. We have also been using SonarQube for analysis but have not had much luck with the preview or incremental modes and GitHub integration. Current versions are SonarQube 5.1.1 and GitHub Plugin version 1.0.1.We have the plug-in installed on SonarQube and have our GitHub Enterprise API configured. We have attempted using the SonarQube Runner in Jenkins and Maven to get this to work following the codetravis.sh script as a guide:a href=https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/blob/master/travis.sh rel=nofollowhttps://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/blob/master/travis.sh/aWe see the Sonar integration show up on GitHub, but it is always successful (we are working with large, legacy code bases and expect to see a lot of output).The thing that is consistent between our javascript and java analysis is that we don't seem to be getting any files indexed and the GitHub Plugin InputFile Cache sensor is used instead of Javascript or Java sensors we are used to seeing during a full analysis. 00:01:57.532 13:12:31.109 INFO - 0 files indexed 00:01:57.533 13:12:31.110 INFO - 25784 files ignored because of inclusion/exclusion patterns00:01:57.535 13:12:31.112 INFO - Quality profile for js: Sonar way00:01:57.758 13:12:31.334 DEBUG - 'SCM Sensor' skipped in preview mode00:01:57.758 13:12:31.335 DEBUG - 'CPD Sensor' skipped in preview mode00:01:57.759 13:12:31.336 DEBUG - Sensors : Lines Sensor (wrapped) -   GitHub Plugin InputFile Cache00:01:57.759 13:12:31.336 INFO - Sensor Lines Sensor (wrapped)00:01:57.759 13:12:31.336 INFO - Sensor Lines Sensor (wrapped) (done) | time=0ms00:01:57.759 13:12:31.336 INFO - Sensor GitHub Plugin InputFile Cache00:01:57.759 13:12:31.336 INFO - Sensor GitHub Plugin InputFile Cache (done) | time=0ms00:01:57.759 13:12:31.336 DEBUG - No previous analysis, skipping issue tracking00:01:57.763 13:12:31.340 INFO - 00:01:57.763 00:01:57.763 ------------- Issues Report -------------00:01:57.763 00:01:57.763 No file analyzed00:01:57.763 00:01:57.763 -------------------------------------------00:01:57.763 00:01:57.763 00:01:57.763 13:12:31.340 INFO - Export issues to /data/jenkins/workspace/mygea-mygeaviation-pullrequests/.sonar/sonar-report.json00:01:57.766 13:12:31.343 INFO - ANALYSIS SUCCESSFUL00:01:57.767 13:12:31.344 DEBUG - Post-jobs : GitHub Pull Request Issue Publisher00:01:57.767 13:12:31.344 INFO - Executing post-job class org.sonar.plugins.github.PullRequestIssuePostJobreAre we missing something simple?Analysis properties are as follows: sonar.projectKey=mygea-ux-pullrequestssonar.projectName=mygea-ux-pullrequestssonar.projectVersion=1.0.0sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8sonar.language=jssonar.sources=./sonar.verbose=truesonar.exclusions=static/ge_ux/**/*, node_modules/**/*, custom-login/custom-login-cfm/iids/**/*, custom-login/custom-login-honda/iids/**/*, custom-login/custom-login-ge/iids/**/*, static/ge.com.2013/components/**/*, static/ge.com.2013/widgets/**/*.min.js, testFiles/**/*, coverage/**/*, gulpfile.js, test-tmp/**/*, extend.js, index.js, static/ge.com.2013/js/**/*.min.jssonar.analysis.mode=previewsonar.issuesReport.console.enable=truesonar.forceUpdate=truesonar.github.pullRequest=$ghprbPullIdsonar.github.repository=mygea/mygeaviationsonar.github.login=*****sonar.github.oauth=*****sonar.github.endpoint=*****reAny assistance on this would be much appreciated!

The comment makes it obvious but what does it do exactly? The documentation for conv_unsigned says that it should return the value 16 as an unsigned value (which it is) of size 7 (which I guess it could be). Doesn't &ing whatever is returned by conv_usigned with 0 just make the whole thing 0?
prod_next <= prod_reg(32) & prod_reg(32 downto 1);
Referring to the comment again, this should just be a shift. What I understand is actually happening is that the 32nd bit of the prod_reg register is &ed with each bit of the same register between the 32nd and 1st bits and then assigned to prod_next. How exactly is this a shift?
The code works when tested so this is 100% a problem with my lack of VHDL knowledge so please forgive me if the questions are dumb.",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.029,0.95,0.021,-0.6942

36287221,SonarQube/SonarLint/Visual Studio: Use one ruleset fo all projects in solution,"We are currently in the process of evaluating the use of SonarQube/SonarLint for our .NET applications. We are pretty happy with what we've seen so far (and, btw, kudos for bringing SonarQube this far - I've used it a couple of years ago for my PhD project, and it has improved greatly since then!).However, one thing was a bit surprising: When I connected my SonarLint instance to our SonarQube server (which worked just fine) and started syncing the bound project, SonarLint started to download nuget packages (which was kind of expected) and then created one or even two .ruleset files for each project of our solution (in addition to a file SonarQube/<solution name>CSharp.ruleset which I assume is the solution-wide ruleset).What I expected and would prefer is only the single ruleset valid for the complete solution (and possibly the option to override that ruleset for projects where this makes sense (e.g., test projects)).Is this behavior possible at all, i.e., did I miss anything?

And it still returns 0, when I expect 1.I'm not sure what's the problem here, did I set up my query wrong?In short, when User A creates a room, the Parse query returns number of users as 0 which is expected.

39525909,SonarQube Technical Debt management with Quality Gate,"Configuring a custom Quality Gate, the default SonarQube Way has been taken as initial reference and further adjusted and customized (adding further checks). Our current quality gate looks as following (old version vs current version): Blocker issues: error threshold at 0Complexity/class: error threshold at 12Complexity/file: error threshold at 12Complexity/function error threshold at 2Coverage error threshold at 100      changed to 65Critical issues error threshold at 0Duplicated lines (%) error threshold at 5Info issues error threshold at 10Major issues error threshold at 50Minor issues error threshold at 100Overall coverage error threshold at 100      changed to 65Public documented API (%) error threshold at 50Skipped Unit tests error threshold at 0Technical Debts error threshold at 10d      change to (??    10)Unit test errors error threshold at 0Unit test failures error threshold at 0reThe main point is about the Technical Debts days, which should be enforced from 10 to something smaller, given that other checks have been relaxed (complexity and coverage). This is indeed reasonable: relaxing some rules you should have more margin for controlled technical debt and hence shorter threshold for the number of accumulated days for uncontrolled technical debt.However, the overall quality gate should somehow (mathematically?) follow a certain proportion.Question: how to calculate the most appropriate technical debt threshold given the relaxations above?From an a href=http://www.sonarqube.org/evaluate-your-technical-debt-with-sonar/ rel=nofollowold article/a (2009, hence most probably not applicable any longer) the following formula has been deducted: TechDebt = (cost_to_fix_one_block * duplicated_blocks) + \ (cost_to fix_one_violation * mandatory_violations) + \ (cost_to_comment_one_API * public_undocumented_api) + \ (cost_to_cover_one_of_complexity * uncovered_complexity_by_tests) + \ (cost_to_split_a_method * function_complexity_distribution) + \ (cost_to_split_a_class * class_complexity_distribution)reNote: code\ added for readability.However, there are too many unknown variables to make a proper calculation, yet it is not covering all of the quality gate items above (again, it's an old reference).Other more recent a href=http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Metric+Definitions rel=nofollowsources/a explain in details concerned items, but not how to adjust values in a proportionated manner.The codesonar.technicalDebt.developmentCost (emAdmin/em / emConfiguration/em / emTechnical Debt/em) has a default value of 30 minutes, which means 1 LOC (cost to develop 1 line of code) = 30, but still not at the granularity level of the variables above nor useful in this case.",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.12,0.838,0.043,-0.954

43386675,Is there a proper replacement for the Filter Motion Chart in sonarqube 6.x,"Sonar is a very good tool to get an overview over the codebase. Its strenght is that you can see a lot of data(and select which data you want) in a single chart.The most useful chart in that sense is the Filter Motion Chart. It aggregates data over projects   time giving the broadest overview possible.I tried and searched a lot and was not able to find a proper replacement in sonar 6.x.ulliHave I overlooked a solution?liIs something planned for a replacement?liWill the Filter Motion Chart be fixed for sonar 6.x?We decided in our company not to upgrade sonar until this problem is fixed. We think that the usefulness of sonar is crippled without this.Edit: Added details as a response to Fabrice solution: (does not fit into comment)I will give you some details so you better understand our needs:We are a team that works together on multible projects. No one has ownership of a single project but the responsibility is shared in the whole team.In our daily work we use sonar to monitor the quality of the code we are working on (writing or reviewing).But as we collaborate on the same codebase and have shared responsibilty, we have to agree on certain standards with the whole team (Coding conventions, typical design patterns, sonar rules and much more...).These things need to be discussed with the whole team. One start point for such discussions is that we look at. What we do is:ulliMark the projects that had changes since we last looked at sonar asfavorites(typically 2 weeks ago)liOpen the filter motion chart to get an overview over the changes since we last metliDrill into the detailsliIf needed Discuss problems, rules, etc.I agree that in my daily work I do not need the broad overview. But as we are a team that is working together weneed this team view as well.block e SonarQube is not meant to be a multi-purpose aggregation platform (...)/block eIt is a pity that you think that way. As a matter of fact: Sonar does a very good job in aggregating data.Timeline, Bubble, etc. are very useful tools for aggregating data. Throwing this away will diminish the usefulnessof sonar. I hope you think about this a second time.block e (...)embrace quality as a day-to-day practice(...)/block eI understand that this is a big part of sonar. The reason that we do not rate this part as important may be related to the fact that we develop c with Visual Studio. With build in features   3rd party plugins Visual Studiois quite ok in giving direct feedback on code quality. This may be different for other languages   toolsets givingthis part of sonar a bigger importace.block e (...)and we feel this is not a good thing (performance wise, UX wise, product wise, ...) (...)/block eI could accept that at an answer: You do not want to do it, because it is difficult!I think that sonar is a very useful tool. You did a very good job developing it. And you developed not onlyrules   quality gates but Timelines, Bubble Charts,...You cannot blame your users for using them!As a user I can tell you: You have users that use these tools!

43629818,Technical debt formula doesn't take into account complexity,"In Sonarqube versions prior to 5.5 there was the possibility to change the way that technical debt is calculated in order to take into account the complexity, but after 5.5 I can’t see how to change it. Did you remove this configuration?IMHO, the cost of remediation is much harder in a complex code than in a simpler one. Here is a a href=https://www.adictosaltrabajo.com/tutoriales/sonarqube-4-5-2/ rel=nofollow noreferrerpost/a where you can see and compare two similar projects with similar technical debt based on size, but with quite different technical debt based on complexity. Also, coverage is affecting to this measure; and I think that it is easier to modify code when you have enough tests and coverage that assures that you are not breaking anything.In sonarqube documentation, the formula that is used to calculate the technical debt ratio is: Remediation cost / (Cost to develop 1 line of code * Number of lines of code)reBut the remediation cost is a fixed amount of time configured on each rule, isn't it?. So it is independent from the complexity you can find in the code.Here is an image where you can see how this could be done in version 5.1.2:a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBGpl.png rel=nofollow noreferrerTechnical debt with complexity/aIs there any way to configure, in LTS or version 6.x , the technical debt so that the complexity is taken into account like it was in previous versions?If not, is that in your road map? Do you have any reference that complexity or coverage does not affect to remediation cost?Thanks in advance.Note: The new concept of cognitive complexity seems very interesting, we're talking again about complexity, it would be a good candidate.

45158713,Is there any way to reference column with different datatype?,"I have 2 schemas/tables as shown:
CREATE TABLE schema1.code_tbl ( code CHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY,
description CHAR(30)
);
CREATE TABLE schema2.record_tbl
( rec_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
curr_code VARCHAR(6),
remarks VARCHAR(30)

I need to create a foreign key reference from curr_code in RECORD_TBL to code in CODE_TBL.
ALTER TABLE schema2.record_tbl
ADD CONSTRAINT record_code_fk
FOREIGN KEY (curr_code)
REFERENCES schema1.code_tbl (code);
This obviously gives me an ORA-02267 (column type incompatible with referenced column) error.
I cannot alter the code column in CODE_TBL because I do not own or control schema1. I cannot alter the curr_code column in RECORD_TBL because it would break many functions in my application because we don't account for trailing whitespaces.
Is there any other way to enforce referential integrity between the 2 columns?",Not-TD-related,SonarQube,,,,0.022,0.893,0.085,0.7695

1891466,So.. I need to train the team on Unit Testing - could use C&C on lesson plan,"So - management is looking to do a push to move towards doing unit-testing in all the applications moving forward - and eventually get into full TDD/Continuous Integration/Automated build mode (I hope). At this point however we are just concerned about getting everyone developing apps moving forward using unit-testing. I'd like to just start with the basics.I won't lie - I'm by far no expert by any means in unit-testing, but I do have a good enough understanding to start the initiative with the basics, and allow us to grow togeather as a team. I'd really love to get some comments   critisism from all you experts on my plan of attack on this thing. It's a team of about 10 developers in a small shop, which makes for a great opportunity to move forward with agile development methodologies and best practices.First off - the team consists of mainly mid level developers with a couple of junior devs and one senior, all with minimal to no exposure to unit testing. The training will be a semi-monthly meeting for about 30-60 minutes each time (probably wind up running an hour long i'd guess, and maybe have them more often). We will continue these meetings until it makes sense to stop them to allow others to catch up with their own 'homework' and experience - but the push will always be on.Anyway - here is my lesson plan I have come up with. Well, the first two at least. Any advice from your experts out there on the actual content or structure of the lessons, etc, would be great. Comments   Critisism greatly appreciated. Thanks very much.I apologize if this is 'too much' to post in here or read through. I think this would be a great thread for SO users looking to get into unit testing in the first place as well. Perhaps you could just skip to the 'lesson plans' section - thanks again everyone.emCLIFF NOTES/em - I realize this post is incredibly long and ugly, so here is the cliff notes - Lesson 1 will be 'hello world unit tests' - Lesson 2 will be opening the solution to my most recent application, and showing how to apply each 'hello world' example in real life... Thanks so much everyone for the feedback you've given me so far.. just wantd to highlight the fact that lesson 2 emis/em going to have real life production unit tests in it, since many suggested I do that when it was my plan from the begining =)emUnit Testing Lesson Plan/emOverviewWhy unit test? Seems like a bunch of extra work - so why do it?• Become the master of your own destiny. Most of our users do not do true UATs, and unfortunately tend to do their testing once in production. With unit-tests, we greatly decrease risk associated with this, especially when we create enough test data and take into account as many top level inputs as we possibly can. While not being a ‘silver bullet’ that prevents all bugs – it is your first line of defense – a huge front line, comparable to that of the SB championship Giants.• Unit-Testing enforces good design and architecture practices. It is ‘the violent psychopath who maintains your code and knows where you live’ so to say. You simply can’t write poor quality code that is well unit-tested• How many times have you not refactored smelly code because you were too scared of breaking something? Automated testing remove this fear, makes refactoring much easier, in turn making code more readable and easier to maintain.• Bottom line – maintenance becomes much easier and cheaper. The time spent writing unit tests might be costly now – but the time it saves you down the road has been proven time and time again to be far more valuable. This is the 1 reason to automate testing your code. It gives us confidence that allows us to take on more ambitious changes to systems that we might have otherwise had to reduce requirements on, or maybe even not take on at all.Terminology Review• Unit testing - testing the lowest level, single unit of work. E.G. – test all possible code paths that a single function can flow through.• Integration testing - testing how your units work together. E.g. – run a ‘job’ (or series of function calls) that does a bunch of work, with known inputs - and then query the database at the end and assert the values are what you expect from those known inputs (instead of having to eye-ball a grid on a web page somewhere, e.g. doing a functional test). • Fakes – a fake is a type of object whose purpose is to use for your testing. It allows you too easily emnot/em test code that you do not want to test. Instead of having to call code that you do not want – like a database call – you use a fake object to ‘fake’ that DB call and perhaps read the data from an XML/Excel file or a mocking framework.o Mock – a type of fake to which you make assert statements against. o Stub – a type of fake to which you use as placeholder code, so you can skip the database call, but do not make asserts againstemLessons/emLesson one – Hello Worlds• Hello World unit test - I will create a ‘hello world’ console application that is unit tested. Will create this application on the fly during the meeting, showing the tools in Visual Studio 2008 (test-project, test tools toolbar, etc.) that we are going to use along the way while explaining what they do. This will have only a single unit-test. (OK, maybe I won’t create it ‘on the fly’ =), have to think about it more). Will also explain the Assert class and its purpose and the general flow of a unit-test.• Hello World, a bit more complicated. Now our function has different paths/logical branches the code can flow through. We will have ~3 unit tests for this function. This will be a pre-written solution I make before the meeting.• Hello World, dependency injection. (Not using any DI frameworks). A pre-written solution that builds off the previous one, this time using dependency injection. Will explain what DI is and show a sample of how it works.• Hello World, Mock Objects. A pre-written solution that builds off the previous one, this time using our newly added DI code to inject a mock object into our class to show how mocking works. Will use NMock2.0 as this is the only one I have exposure to. Very simple example to just display the use of mock objects. (Perhaps put this one in a separate lesson?).• Hello World, (non-automated) Integration Test. Building off the previous solution, we create an integration test so show how to test 2 functions together, or entire class together (perhaps put this one in a separate lesson?)Lesson two – now we know the basics – how to apply this in real life?• General overview of best practices o Rule 1- Single Responsibility Principal. Single Responsibility Principal. Single Responsibility Principal. Facetiously stating that this is the single most important thing to keep in mind while writing your code. A class should have only one purpose; a function should do only one thing. The key word here is ‘unit’ test – and the SRP will keep your classes   functions encapsulated into units.o Dependency Injection is your second best friend. DI allows you to ‘plug’ behavior into classes you have, at run time. Among other things, this is how we use mocking frameworks to make our bigger classes more easily testable.o Always think ‘how will I test this’ as you are writing code. If it seems ‘too hard to test’, it is likely that your code is too complicated. Re-factor until it into more logical units of classes/functions - take that one class that does 5 things and turn it into 5 classes, one which calls the other 4. Now your code will be much easier to test – and also easier to read and refactor as well.o Test embehavior/em, not implementation. In nutshell, this means that we can for the most part test only the Public functions on our classes. We don’t care about testing the private ones (implementation), because the public ones (behavior) are what our calling code uses. For example... I’m a millionaire software developer and go to the Aston Martin dealership to buy myself a brand new DB9. The sales guy tells me that it can do 0-60 in 3 seconds. How would you test this? Would you lift the engine out and perform diagnostics tests, etc..? No... You would take it onto the parkway and do 160 MPH =). This is testing behavior vs. implementation.• Reviewing a real life unit-tested application. Here we will go over each of the above ‘hello world’ examples – but the real life versions, using my most recent project as an example. I'll open a simple unit test, a more complex one, one that uses DI, and one that uses Mocks (probably coupled to the DI one). This project is fairly small   simple so it is really a perfect fit. This will also include testing the DAL and how to setup a test database to run these tests against.",TD-related,test,"software_methodology, missing_tests, automation, complex_testing",3,1554,0.061,0.819,0.12,0.9986

It was started 18 months ago before I could really see any benefit of TDD (face palm), so now it's a rather large solution with a number of projects and I haven't the foggiest idea where to start in adding unit tests. What's making me consider this is that occasionally an old bug seems to resurface, or a bug is checked in as fixed without really being fixed. Unit testing would reduce or prevents these issues occuring.By reading similar questions on SO, I've seen recommendations such as starting at the bug tracker and writing a test case for each bug to prevent regression. However, I'm concerned that I'll end up missing the big picture and end up missing fundamental tests that would have been included if I'd used TDD from the get go.Are there any process/steps that should be adhered to in order to ensure that an existing solutions is properly unit tested and not just bodged in? How can I ensure that the tests are of a good quality and aren't just a case of any test is better than no tests.So I guess what I'm also asking is;Is it worth the effort for an existing solution that's in production?Would it better to ignore the testing for this project and add it in a possible future re-write?What will be more benefical; spending a few weeks adding tests or a few weeks adding functionality?

44203976,What is the best strategy to do decoupling assemblies,"I got a problem with a legacy code base in my new company.Basically, they have 2 big code basesrojects or assemblies which I would say assembly A and assembly B. Also, we are having assembly Test A and assembly Test B.The problem I got here is assembly Test A is using some classes from assembly Test B. And assembly Test B is using some classes from assembly Test A. But not finish, assembly Test A is using some classes from assembly B. It is really nasty, I know that. That is the reason now in technically, we are having 2 separate projects but actually we put them in one package. Then you can imagine that every time we deploy A then we have to deploy B.My task is to decouple those assemblies or splitting them into 2 separate assemblyroject so it will be good for future deployment and testing and whatever.I came to a strategy which is a slow process but it might make sure that we still guarantee the functionalities. My initial strategy is that I will slowly remove the dependencies of assembly B in testing assembly A and make the tests pass with testing assembly A. It means I am removing dependencies of assembly B from assembly A. Next step is doing the same way with assembly B and finally we will have 2 completed separate assemblies.For me, I believe that it is not a easy task but I dont mind to work on that. However, I need your opinion or advises on my initial strategy. I dont want to take a risk of coming back to the beginning in the middle of that kind of project.
So could you guys give me any honest opinion or pieces of advice on that task?

50756436,The cost of setting up tests in JUnit - using mocked objects versus repository-tests in legacy code,"I work on a project which has existed for many years. The time it takes to build the project with all tests is almost sensational (not in a good way). This is mainly due to a lot of modules, as well as heaps of unit tests which uses a repository to set up test data rather then to mock the desired behaviour. Unit tests using a repository use a lot of time for test setup, and they run quite slowly. This adds up to a lot of time as the system is quite large.We write all new unit tests by using Mockito to mock the repository (except when we are emactually/em testing the repository obviously). We also try to rewrite all existing unit tests to using mocks of the repository instead of an actual repository whenever we have the time and opportunity. Completely eliminating the use of repo's in our tests has a emhuge/em effect on how much time it takes to run the tests.A lot of the legacy code sets up its test data by using builders and test-utilities which in turn uses the repository. As the domain is quite complex, this often involves setting up a fair amount of objects and how they are related to each other. Re-writing a class of tests (say ~15 tests) to using only mocked object can therefore be quite time-consuming. And as everywhere else, time is not an infinite resource.If we are adding some new functionality to a class, it would be far easier to just write one new repository test (in addition to the existing 15) than to find out exactly how the test data needs to be set up by using different mock objects.I have tried to find some information on how and to what extent the test setup affects the actual time it takes to run the tests, but I have failed to find any useful information. My only facts are the observations I make when running a test class. The test setup for a repo test may easily take ~10 seconds, while the test setup for a mocked test class starts in less than a second.NOTE: I am aware that I can use JUnit Stopwatch to benchmark a single or a set of tests, but my question is more concerned with best practices than exactly how long it takes me to run my tests. I have two questions:olliSay I encounter a test class which already has 15 unit tests where none of them mocks any behaviour. I write a test and do a small fix in the class. I do not have the time to re-write the whole test class to mock objects. Should I just add a new test without mocking any behaviour and follow the existing (and bad) pattern? Does it really matter whether I have 15 non-mocked tests and 1 mocked test or if I have 16 non-mocked tests?liIn my test class with 15 unit tests, some of the tests are easier to refactor than others. Is it worth it to re-write only five of the tests to using mocked objects? Is it against best practice or in any other way not good to have a test class where some of the tests uses mocks and some don't?",TD-related,test,"legacy, mock",6,543,0.061,0.858,0.081,0.8963

And that leads to my question, which I couldn't find an answer to so far: how would the interface look like? My guess is, that it should be all abstract, so:class IMyClass{...virtual void MyFunction(std::shared_ptr<IMyOtherClass> parameter) = 0;}That leaves me with three files for every class: all virtual base interface class, production implementation using all production parameters and mock implementation using all mock parameters.

public class User

using (MainContext context = new MainContext())
{
return context.Users.Count();
}
}
}
public Guid Id { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid();
public string UserName { get; set; }
public string Password { get; set; }
public Contact UserContact { get; set; }
}
My first test is UsersCount_Test test which tests UsersCount property:
[TestMethod]
public void UsersCount_Test()
{
var user = new User();
var context = new MainContext();
int usersCount = context.Users.Count();
context.Users.Add(new User());
context.SaveChanges();
Assert.AreEqual(usersCount + 1, user.UsersCount, $""It should be {usersCount + 1} because we're adding one more user"");
}
If I add new test method in my test class (I'm using separate classes for testing each entity), I need to create new instance of User. That's why I did this:
public class BaseTest<T>
{
public T TestEntity;
public MainContext TestContext = new MainContext();
}
Now each test classes inherits from this class. And also I created test initializer method. Now my test class looks like this :
[TestClass]
public class UserTest : BaseTest<User>
{
[TestMethod]
public void UsersCount()
{
int usersCount = TestContext.Users.Count();
TestContext.Users.Add(new User());
TestContext.SaveChanges();
Assert.AreEqual(usersCount + 1, TestEntity.UsersCount, $""It should be {usersCount + 1} because we're adding one more user"");
}
[TestInitialize]
public void SetTestEntity()
{
TestEntity = new User();
}
}
Now I'm adding new property to User and writing some logic:
string phoneNumber;
public string PhoneNumber { get { return phoneNumber; } set { SetUserContact(phoneNumber, value); phoneNumber = value; } }
void SetUserContact(string oldContact, string newContact)
{
UserContact.ContactsList.Remove(oldContact);
UserContact.ContactsList.Add(newContact);
}
After that I'm creating new test :
[TestMethod]
public void ContactList_Test()
{
var newPhone = ""+8888888888888"";
TestEntity.PhoneNumber = newPhone;
Assert.IsTrue(TestEntity.UserContact.ContactsList.Any(a => a == newPhone), $""It should contains {newPhone}"");
}
Test fails because UserContact of TestEntity is null. I understood that TestEntity should be created by logic. After that I fix test initilizer method:
[TestInitialize]
public void SetTestEntity()
{
TestEntity = new User() { UserContact = new Contact() };
}
Here is Contact model
public class Contact
{
public Guid Id { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid();
public virtual List<string> ContactsList { get; set; } = new List<string>();
}
My question is how to set TestEntity only one time, is it possible (maybe get it in memory and use it when it calls SetTestEntity method)? Because SetTestentity method creates a new entity in each test and it takes more development time. (For example, If creating an instance of UserContact takes 3 seconds all, test runs more than 3 seconds). Another way, in this case, is to set UserContact in ContactLists test, but I think it's not a good idea. In the future when we will add new logics, I need to fix each test.

Unfortunately, it takes days to run them all, not seconds. These exercise all the code we care the most about, but they are just too slow.

We need to figure out how to handle general code improvements / technical debt fixes that come up while working on a feature.The workflow we have adopted is to use 'develop' as the main integration branch and develop all features on feature branches off of 'develop'. When a feature is complete, the developer creates a pull request and everyone reviews it to provide comments before it is merged back into develop. This seems to be working very well.The issue we have is that during routine development on a feature, the developer may end up wanting to modify/refactor some common code to improve the system or clean up some technical debt. This change is valuable, but not directly tied to the feature under development.Based on our workflow, it should really be done on a different branch that goes through it's own pull request and code review before getting into develop. If we have them do this though, how can they get the change back over onto their feature branch in the meantime while they wait for the full code review to happen and the code to get merged into develop.The ideas we have are:1) cherry-pick the changes from the 'refactorX' branch into our feature branch. Continue developing and let git (hopefully) figure out when we merge back to develop that it already has the change from the refactor branch.2) Merge the 'refactorX' branch into our feature branch and continue development. (note: the branch off develop for 'refactorX' may have been later in the history of develop, so we think this may have problems)3) Some other smarter option we don't know yet. :)What we are looking for is some best practice guidance on how to handle this part of the workflow. After talking about it more we know that it will come up frequently and we want to find a smooth and efficient way to handle it in our workflow.Any recommendations?",TD-related,versioning,brenching_hell,2,339,0.01,0.921,0.069,0.9612

26127900,"TFS Branch for Custom Version, Excluding those Customizations from Merging Back?","I recently inherited an ASP.Net Web Forms project that has no version control and I am trying to move it into TFS. At some point the project was split to make a custom version for a client where the login uses ADFS instead of our database-driven form. After the split some features were added to the main version to manage users; these were not needed in the custom version. Any changes to one version were manually applied to the other if they affected the non-customized parts (although, predictably, this was sometimes forgotten). Each version had a folder on the dev and production servers, so the folder structure is like this: roduction/Generalroduction/Custom/Dev/General/Dev/CustomreAssuming it would be difficult to merge the two versions completely with feature toggles, what is the best approach to managing this?I was thinking I could use diff to pull out what the production versions have in common and make that my MAIN branch. I could then make the two production versions branch from MAIN and have their current state as the first check-in, then do a similar thing for the dev folders, like this: - MAIN | |- General | |- GeneralDev | |- Custom |- CustomDevreHowever, I'm not sure how to manage merging.
